# 🌐 **HTTP STATUS CODES — DEFINITIONS + EXAMPLES + MEMORY TRICKS**

HTTP Status Codes are **3-digit numbers** returned by a web server to indicate the result of a client’s request.
They are grouped into **five categories**:

| Category | Range   | Meaning                            | Emoji |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- | ----- |
| **1xx**  | 100–199 | Informational / Request Processing | 🛈    |
| **2xx**  | 200–299 | Success                            | ✅     |
| **3xx**  | 300–399 | Redirection                        | 🔁    |
| **4xx**  | 400–499 | Client Error                       | ❌     |
| **5xx**  | 500–599 | Server Error                       | 💥    |

# 🟦 **1xx — INFORMATIONAL RESPONSES** (Request Received, Still Processing)

---

## **100 Continue**

**Definition:**
Server indicates that the initial part of the request has been received and the client may continue sending the rest of the data.

Server replies:

> "Continue sending the file."

---

---

## **102 Processing**

**Definition:**
Server has accepted the request but is still processing it; no final response available yet.

**Example:**

# 🟩 **2xx — SUCCESS RESPONSES** (Request Completed Successfully)

---

## **200 OK**

---

## **206 Partial Content**
