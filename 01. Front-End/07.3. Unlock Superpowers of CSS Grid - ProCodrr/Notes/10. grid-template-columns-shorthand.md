Below is a detailed explanation of each shorthand variant for defining grid columns using the `repeat()` function along with their behavior and expected output.

---

## **1. `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, auto);`**

### **What It Means:**
- **`repeat(4, auto)`** creates **4 columns**.
- Each column’s width is set to **`auto`**, which means that the width is determined by the content inside each column (including padding and borders).

### **Behavior:**
- **Content-Driven:** The width of each column adjusts based on the widest item in that column.
- **No Fixed Width:** If content is small, columns may be narrow; if content is large, they may become wider.
- **Consistent Number:** You always get exactly 4 columns regardless of container width.

### **Visual Example (Conceptual):**
Imagine a grid with 4 cells in a row:
```
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
|   auto  |   auto  |   auto  |   auto  |
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
```
Each cell's width changes depending on its content.

## **2. `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 100px);`**

### **What It Means:**
- **`auto-fill`** tells the grid to **create as many 100px-wide columns as can fit** in the container.
- Each column has a fixed width of **100px**.

### **Behavior:**
- **Responsive Count:** The number of columns adapts to the container’s width.
- **Empty Tracks:** If there are fewer grid items than available columns, empty (but fixed-width) tracks are created.
- **Example:**  
  - If the container is 500px wide, it can fit 5 columns of 100px (plus any gaps).
  - As the container resizes, the grid automatically adds or removes columns.

### **Visual Example:**
For a container 500px wide:
```
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```
Items will be placed into these columns, and any extra tracks may remain empty if there aren’t enough items.

## **3. `grid-template-columns: repeat(5, minmax(80px, 100px));`**

### **What It Means:**
- This defines exactly **5 columns**.
- Each column will have a **minimum width of 80px** and a **maximum width of 100px**.

### **Behavior:**
- **Fixed Maximum:** No column will be wider than 100px even if extra space is available.
- **Responsive Minimum:** If the container is too narrow, each column can shrink but will not be smaller than 80px.
- **Equal Columns:** The grid always creates 5 columns, and each column’s width adjusts within the 80–100px range based on available space.

### **Visual Example:**
For a container wide enough to use the maximum:
```
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```
If space is limited, they might all shrink to around 80px (if necessary).

## **4. `grid-template-columns: repeat(5, minmax(80px, 1fr));`**

### **What It Means:**
- This again creates **5 columns**.
- Each column has a **minimum width of 80px** but can grow using the fractional unit **`1fr`** if extra space is available.

### **Behavior:**
- **Flexible Expansion:** The columns share any extra available space equally.
- **Minimum Constraint:** Even if the container is narrow, each column will be at least 80px wide.
- **Equal Distribution:** Extra space is divided equally among all 5 columns, making them fluid and responsive.

### **Visual Example:**
- In a very wide container, the columns might each expand to, say, 150px:
  ```
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
  |  150  |  150  |  150  |  150  |  150  |
  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
  ```
- In a narrow container, they might be close to 80px each.

## **5. `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(100px, 1fr));`**

### **What It Means:**
- **`auto-fill`** directs the grid to create as many columns as possible within the container.
- Each column is defined by **`minmax(100px, 1fr)`**:
  - **Minimum width:** 100px.
  - **Maximum width:** It can expand to fill the available space equally (using `1fr`).

### **Behavior:**
- **Responsive Column Count:** The grid creates as many columns as can fit, each being at least 100px wide.
- **Flexible Sizing:** Extra space in the container is distributed among all columns, so they expand equally.
- **Dynamic Layout:** As the container resizes, the number of columns changes—if the container gets wider, more columns may fit; if narrower, fewer columns.

### **Visual Example:**
- For a container 500px wide:
  - It might create 5 columns if space allows, each starting at 100px, but if extra space exists, columns expand to fill the gap equally.
- For a container 750px wide:
  - It might create 7 columns if possible, with each column growing to share the extra space equally.

## **Summary of Each Variant**

1. **`repeat(4, auto)`**  
   - **Creates 4 columns** with widths determined entirely by content.
   - Use when you want each column to adapt to the size of its content.

2. **`repeat(auto-fill, 100px)`**  
   - **Creates as many 100px columns as will fit** in the container.
   - Use when you need a fixed-width column layout that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on container size.

3. **`repeat(5, minmax(80px, 100px))`**  
   - **Creates 5 columns** with widths that can shrink to **80px** or grow to **100px**.
   - Use when you need fixed, but slightly flexible, column widths.

4. **`repeat(5, minmax(80px, 1fr))`**  
   - **Creates 5 columns** with a minimum width of **80px** that can grow to fill available space equally.
   - Use when you want a set number of columns that remain responsive and evenly distribute extra space.

5. **`repeat(auto-fill, minmax(100px, 1fr))`**  
   - **Dynamically creates as many columns as possible**, each being at least **100px** wide and expanding equally if extra space exists.
   - Use for responsive grid layouts where the number of columns adjusts automatically with the container’s width.

Each of these variants helps you control how grid columns behave and respond to different container sizes, offering a range of options from fixed to fully responsive layouts.
