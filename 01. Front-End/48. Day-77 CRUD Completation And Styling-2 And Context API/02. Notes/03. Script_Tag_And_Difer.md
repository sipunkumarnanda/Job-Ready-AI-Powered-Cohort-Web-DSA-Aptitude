
# Understanding the `<script>` Tag in HTML: A Beginner’s Guide

---

## What is the `<script>` Tag?

The `<script>` tag is how you add JavaScript to your webpage. JavaScript makes websites interactive, like clicking buttons, showing pop-ups, loading data, and much more.

You can put your JavaScript **inside the HTML file** or load it from an **external file**. How you do that affects how your webpage loads and behaves.

## 1. Inline Script — Writing JavaScript Inside HTML

### What it looks like:

```html
<script>
  alert('Hello, welcome!');
</script>
```

### What happens?

* The browser reads your HTML from top to bottom.
* When it reaches the `<script>` tag, it **pauses** parsing the HTML.
* It runs the JavaScript right there, immediately.
* Only after the script runs does it continue parsing the rest of the HTML.

### Why use this?

* For quick small bits of JavaScript, like alerts or simple code.
* No need to create a separate file.

### Downsides?

* If the script is big or slow, it **blocks** the page loading (the browser waits).
* Mixing HTML and JS can get messy with bigger projects.

## 2. External Script — Loading JavaScript from Another File

### What it looks like:

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

### What happens?

* The browser finds the `<script src="app.js">` tag.
* It **pauses parsing HTML** to download the `app.js` file.
* Once downloaded, it **runs** the script.
* Then it continues parsing the rest of the HTML.

### Why use this?

* Keeps HTML clean and easier to read.
* You can reuse the same script on multiple pages.
* Browser can cache the JS file to speed up repeat visits.

### Downsides?

* Still **blocks HTML parsing** while downloading and running the script.
* If the script is big, this can slow down page loading.

## 3. `defer` Attribute — Load JS without Blocking HTML Parsing

### What it looks like:

```html
<script src="app.js" defer></script>
```

### What happens?

* The browser **downloads** `app.js` **in the background** while still parsing the HTML.
* The script execution is **deferred** until **after** the entire HTML is parsed.
* Scripts with `defer` execute **in the order** they appear in the HTML.

### Why use this?

* Your page loads and displays content faster because the browser isn’t waiting for JS to finish first.
* Good for scripts that need the **whole page loaded** before running, like scripts that modify the DOM.
* Keeps the order predictable if you have multiple scripts.

### Downsides?

* Older browsers might not support it fully (but most modern browsers do).
* Your script won’t run until the full HTML is ready.

## 4. `async` Attribute — Load JS Asynchronously

### What it looks like:

```html
<script src="app.js" async></script>
```

### What happens?

* The browser downloads `app.js` **in the background** while parsing HTML.
* As soon as the file finishes downloading, the script **executes immediately** — even if the HTML parsing isn’t done.
* Execution order **is NOT guaranteed** if multiple async scripts are used.

### Why use this?

* Perfect for scripts that don’t depend on DOM elements or other scripts, like analytics or ads.
* Speeds up page load because it doesn’t block HTML parsing.

### Downsides?

* If the script needs to manipulate the DOM or run after other scripts, this can cause errors.
* Harder to manage order when using multiple async scripts.

## 5. Module Script — Modern JavaScript Modules

### What it looks like:

```html
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
```

### What happens?

* Supports modern JavaScript **modules** using `import` and `export`.
* Module scripts are **deferred by default**, so they behave like `defer` scripts (run after HTML parsing).
* Modules run in **strict mode** by default.
* Each module has its own **scope** (variables inside don’t leak globally).
* Can import other JS modules/files inside the script.

### Why use this?

* Lets you write modular, reusable, maintainable JS code.
* Supported natively in modern browsers.
* Great for bigger, modern projects.

### Downsides?

* Older browsers don’t support modules (you may need a build tool or transpiler).
* You have to serve your JS with the right headers (usually not an issue in dev servers).

# Recap in Simple Terms

| Method                   | When It Runs                    | Effect on Page Load                         | Best For                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Inline `<script>`        | Immediately during HTML parsing | Blocks page loading                         | Tiny quick scripts                  |
| External `<script>`      | Immediately during HTML parsing | Blocks page loading                         | Scripts needing immediate run       |
| `<script defer>`         | After HTML fully parsed         | Doesn’t block parsing, preserves order      | DOM manipulation, dependent scripts |
| `<script async>`         | As soon as script downloads     | Doesn’t block parsing, order not guaranteed | Independent scripts like analytics  |
| `<script type="module">` | After HTML parsing (like defer) | Doesn’t block parsing, supports modules     | Modern modular JS projects          |

# Why Does This Matter?

Because how and when your JavaScript runs affects:

* **How fast your page loads**
* **Whether your scripts work correctly** (especially if they depend on HTML elements)
* **User experience** (you want fast pages that don’t freeze)
* **Maintainability and scalability** of your code

---

# Example: Using `defer` for DOM Manipulation

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Defer Example</title>
  <script src="app.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="title">Hello!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In `app.js`:

```js
document.getElementById('title').textContent = "Hello from deferred JS!";
```

* The script runs *after* the `<h1>` exists in the DOM.
* If you didn’t use `defer`, the script might run too early and fail.
