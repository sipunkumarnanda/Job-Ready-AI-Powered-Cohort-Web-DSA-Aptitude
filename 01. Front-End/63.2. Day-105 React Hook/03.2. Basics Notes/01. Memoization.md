## ✅ What is Memoization?

**Memoization** is a **performance optimization technique** used to **speed up function calls** by **caching previously computed results**.

> In simple terms:
> **“Don’t recalculate the result if the input hasn’t changed. Just reuse the old answer.”**

---

### 🧠 Why do we need memoization?

In programming, functions often:

* Take the same inputs
* Return the same outputs
* Are called **again and again unnecessarily**

If we **cache** those results, we can:

* Avoid **repeating slow or expensive computations**
* Save **processing time**
* Improve **performance**, especially in UI-heavy apps (like React)

---

## 📦 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you run a shop and calculate discounts for customers. If someone comes with the same product and same coupon again:

* ❌ **Without memoization:** You do the full calculation again
* ✅ **With memoization:** You look it up in your notebook (cache)

You save time and avoid repeating the same work.

## 🧪 Code Example (Vanilla JS Memoization)

### ❌ Normal function:

```js
function slowSquare(n) {
  console.log("Calculating...");
  return n * n;
}

slowSquare(4); // calculates
slowSquare(4); // calculates again (wasteful)
```

### ✅ Memoized version:

```js
const memoSquare = () => {
  const cache = {};

  return (n) => {
    if (cache[n]) {
      console.log("Using cached result");
      return cache[n];
    }
    console.log("Calculating...");
    cache[n] = n * n;
    return cache[n];
  };
};

const square = memoSquare();

square(4); // "Calculating..." → 16
square(4); // "Using cached result" → 16 (faster)
```

## 🔄 Memoization in React

React re-renders components often. That means:

* Functions run repeatedly
* Components re-render unnecessarily

So React provides built-in tools for memoization:

| Hook / API    | What it Memoizes               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `useMemo`     | Memoizes **computed values**   |
| `useCallback` | Memoizes **functions**         |
| `React.memo`  | Memoizes **entire components** |

---

### 🔹 `useMemo` example

```js
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => slowFunction(x), [x]);
```

✅ Only recalculates when `x` changes
❌ Without `useMemo`, `slowFunction` would run every render

---

### 🔹 `useCallback` example

```js
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething();
}, []);
```

✅ Function is reused (same reference)
❌ Without `useCallback`, new function created every render

---

### 🔹 `React.memo` example

```js
const Child = React.memo((props) => {
  // Will not re-render if props are same
});
```

✅ Child won’t re-render unless props change
❌ Without `memo`, React re-renders child every time parent re-renders

---

## ⚠️ When **not** to use memoization?

* When functions/values are **cheap to calculate**
* When dependencies **change very often**
* When it adds **complexity without noticeable gain**

> Memoization is an optimization — don’t optimize blindly.

| Feature    | Description                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition | Storing previously computed results for faster re-use            |
| Purpose    | Avoid redoing the same calculations                              |
| Benefits   | Performance boost, reduced CPU usage, better UX                  |
| In React   | `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo` implement memoization |
| Best for   | Expensive computations, pure functions, stable props             |
| Analogy    | Like writing results in a notebook so you don’t recalculate them |

## 🧑‍🏫 Final Simple Explanation

> **Memoization** is a trick where your code remembers old answers, so it doesn't have to redo the same work if the input is the same.

React gives you tools like:

* `useMemo` (for values),
* `useCallback` (for functions),
* `React.memo` (for components)

…all of which use memoization under the hood.
