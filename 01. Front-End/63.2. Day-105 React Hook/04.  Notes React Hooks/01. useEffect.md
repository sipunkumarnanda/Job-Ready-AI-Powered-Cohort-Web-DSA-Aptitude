
# `useEffect` hook is used to perform **side effects** in functional components. Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world or affect things outside the component (e.g., fetching data, setting up subscriptions, manually changing the DOM, etc.).

### **Basic Syntax:**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run on effect
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

---

### **How It Works:**

#### 1. **When It Runs**

* **On initial render** (component mount)
* **On every re-render** if the values in the **dependency array** change

#### 2. **Dependency Array**

* **Empty array `[]`** → Runs **only once** (on mount)
* **With dependencies `[value]`** → Runs when `value` changes
* **No array** → Runs on **every render**

---

### **Examples:**

#### 1. **Run on Mount**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted");
}, []);
```

#### 2. **Run on Dependency Change**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Count changed:", count);
}, [count]);
```

#### 3. **Cleanup (like componentWillUnmount)**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => console.log("Tick"), 1000);

  return () => {
    clearInterval(timer); // Cleanup
    console.log("Cleanup");
  };
}, []);
```

---

### **Common Use Cases:**

* Data fetching (`fetch`, `axios`)
* Subscribing to events (e.g., WebSocket, window events)
* Setting timers/intervals
* DOM manipulation
* Cleanup (clear intervals, unsubscribe, etc.)

---

### **React Lifecycle Comparison:**

In class components:

* `componentDidMount` → `useEffect(..., [])`
* `componentDidUpdate` → `useEffect(..., [deps])`
* `componentWillUnmount` → cleanup inside `useEffect`

# Let's break it down step by step to clearly understand **when and why** `fetchProducts` is called inside the `useEffect`.

---

### **Code Summary:**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchProducts();
}, []);
```

This `useEffect` has an **empty dependency array** (`[]`), which means:

* It will **run only once** after the **first render** of the component.
* It's equivalent to `componentDidMount` in class components.

Inside it, you are calling `fetchProducts()`, which is an async function that makes an API request using Axios.

---

### **So, When Is `fetchProducts` Called?**

`fetchProducts` is called:

✅ **Immediately after the first render** of the component (mount phase), but **not during render** — it happens **after** the DOM has been painted.

---

### **Execution Flow:**

1. **Component renders for the first time**
2. React runs the code inside `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])`
3. `fetchProducts()` is called
4. Axios makes a GET request:
   `/products?_limit=10&_start=${products.length}`
   (since `products` is probably an empty array initially, this means `_start=0`)
5. If the response (`data`) is non-empty:

   * You append it to your `products` state using:

     ```js
     setProducts([...products, ...data])
     ```
6. If it's empty, it sets `hasMore` to false

---

### **Tip (Important Note):**

You're using `products.length` inside `fetchProducts`, but if you plan to call `fetchProducts` again (like in infinite scroll), **you should memoize** or update it safely to avoid stale closures.

For repeated calls like infinite scroll, consider:

* Wrapping `fetchProducts` in `useCallback`
* Using functional updates:

  ```js
  setProducts(prev => [...prev, ...data])
  ```

# Let's break down the **`useEffect`** in your `Products` component step by step:

---

### **The `useEffect` in Your Code:**

```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetchProducts();
}, []);
```

---

### **1. What is the purpose of this `useEffect`?**

This `useEffect` runs **only once**, when the `Products` component is **first mounted (loaded)**. It calls the `fetchProducts()` function, which fetches the **initial 10 products** from the API.

#### So in short:

> **It loads the first batch of products when the page/component is loaded.**

Without this `useEffect`, your page would show **no products at all initially**, because `fetchProducts()` would never run.

---

### **2. Why do we use `useEffect` here?**

Because in React functional components:

* You **cannot call async/side-effect code** like `axios.get()` directly during render.
* So, `useEffect` is the correct place to run side effects like:

  * Fetching data
  * Subscribing to events
  * Starting timers

In your case:

* You are **fetching data from an API** when the component is mounted → this is a classic **side effect** → hence we use `useEffect`.

---

### **3. How `useEffect` works in this code?**

#### Initial Flow:

1. Component renders for the first time
2. React sees `useEffect(() => fetchProducts(), [])`
3. Since the dependency array is `[]`, it runs only **after the first render**
4. `fetchProducts()` is called
5. Inside `fetchProducts()`:

   * Axios sends a GET request to `/products?_limit=10&_start=0`
   * It receives data (first 10 products)
   * `setProducts([...products, ...data])` adds them to the `products` state
   * Component re-renders and shows the products

---

### **4. What happens on further scroll (infinite scroll)?**

* The `InfiniteScroll` component automatically calls the `next` function, which is again `fetchProducts`
* This time, since `products.length` is 10, the API call becomes:
  `/products?_limit=10&_start=10`
* And so on, until no more products are returned → then `hasMore` becomes `false` and loading stops

---

### **Conclusion:**

The `useEffect` in your code:

| What it does                     | Why it’s needed                        | How it works                             |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Runs `fetchProducts()` once      | To load products when component mounts | Executes after first render              |
| Uses empty dependency array `[]` | So it doesn't re-run unnecessarily     | Makes it behave like `componentDidMount` |

# Great follow-up! Let's break down **what happens when you add dependencies inside the dependency array** in `useEffect`.

---

### ✅ Syntax Recap:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // your side effect code
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

---

### **What Happens When There Are Dependencies?**

If you put something (like state or props) in the dependency array:

* `useEffect` will **run once after the first render**, just like before.
* BUT it will **run again every time any dependency value changes**.

---

### 🔁 Example:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Count changed:", count);
}, [count]);
```

* On first render → effect runs
* When `count` changes (via `setCount`) → effect runs **again**
* If `count` doesn’t change → effect doesn't run

---

### 📦 Your Case Example (the `Products` component):

Suppose you did:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetchProducts();
}, [products]);
```

Then:

* It would **run `fetchProducts()` every time `products` changes**
* But inside `fetchProducts()` you're calling `setProducts([...products, ...data])`, which **changes `products`**
* That change triggers `useEffect` again
* This causes an **infinite loop** — `fetchProducts → setProducts → useEffect → fetchProducts → ...`

⚠️ **This is dangerous unless carefully controlled.**

---

### ✅ When to Use Dependencies?

Only add variables to the array if you **want the effect to re-run when those variables change**.

Common examples:

```js
// Re-run when "id" changes (like in a product detail page)
useEffect(() => {
  fetchProductDetails(id);
}, [id]);
```

```js
// Re-run when a search term changes
useEffect(() => {
  fetchResults(query);
}, [query]);
```

### 🧠 Summary:

| Dependency Array      | When useEffect runs                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `[]`                  | Only **once** on mount                       |
| `[a, b]`              | On mount + **every time `a` or `b` changes** |
| *No dependency array* | On **every render**                          |
