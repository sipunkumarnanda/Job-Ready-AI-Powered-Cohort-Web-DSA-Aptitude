
# Let's clarify **why `console.log("Hello")` runs every time** you change `add` or `sub`.

---

### ✅ Why does `"Hello"` log every time?

Because:

```js
console.log("Hello");
```

is **outside** of any hook — it's inside the **main body** of your `App` component.

---

### 📦 In React, what happens when `add` or `sub` changes?

When you click the **+** or **−** button:

1. React calls `setAdd()` or `setSub()`
2. This causes the **`App` component to re-render**
3. On every re-render:

   * The entire **function body of `App` is executed again**
   * That includes your `console.log("Hello")`

---

### 🔄 React Functional Component = Re-executed on Every Render

Every time state or props change, React:

* Calls your component function again from top to bottom
* Re-evaluates hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo` using its internal tracking

So this line:

```js
console.log("Hello");
```

Will always log on **every re-render**, because it's just a regular JS statement inside a function that React re-runs.

---

### 🔧 How to log only once on mount?

If you want `Hello` to print only **once** when the component is mounted:

Use `useEffect`:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Hello");
}, []); // Only runs once
```

### 🧠 Summary

| Code placement                        | Runs when?                        |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `console.log()` inside component body | On **every render**               |
| Inside `useEffect(() => {}, [])`      | Only **once**, after first render |
| Inside `useMemo(() => {}, [deps])`    | When dependencies change          |

# mean useMemo prevent to call func inside useMemo when component rerendering ? 


## Yes — **that's exactly right!**

### ✅ `useMemo` **prevents the function from re-running** on every re-render — it only re-runs when the **dependencies change**.

---

### 🔁 Normal behavior (without `useMemo`):

```js
const result = expensiveFunction(a, b);
```

* This **runs on every render**, even if `a` and `b` haven't changed.

---

### 🧠 With `useMemo`:

```js
const result = useMemo(() => expensiveFunction(a, b), [a, b]);
```

* React **caches** the result of `expensiveFunction(a, b)`
* It will **only re-run the function** if `a` or `b` has changed since the last render
* If not, it just **returns the cached result**

---

### 📦 Example:

```js
const product = useMemo(() => {
  console.log("Product called!");
  return add * 2;
}, [add]);
```

* If `add` changes → `useMemo` re-runs → logs "Product called!"
* If only `sub` changes → `useMemo` **does NOT run again** → skips computation

---

### ❌ What `useMemo` does **not** do:

* It doesn't stop your **component** from re-rendering
* It doesn't run side effects (like `useEffect`)
* It doesn't run code on **unmount**

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Behavior                         | useMemo                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Function re-runs on every render | ❌ (only runs if dependencies change) |
| Returns cached value             | ✅                                    |
| Useful for expensive computation | ✅                                    |
| Prevents component re-render     | ❌ (use `React.memo` for that)        |

# Good question — and it's a **common confusion** between `useMemo` and `useEffect`.

---

### ❓ Does `useMemo` stop a function from being called when component mounts or unmounts?

**Answer: No, `useMemo` does not control when a function is called.**
Instead, it **memoizes the *result* of a function**, not its execution as a side effect.

---

### **What `useMemo` Really Does:**

```js
const result = useMemo(() => {
  return expensiveCalculation(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```

* It **calls** `expensiveCalculation(a, b)`:

  * On first render (mount)
  * On any re-render where `a` or `b` changes
* It **does not run** when the component unmounts
* It **does not perform cleanup**
* It **does not prevent** the function from being called when the component mounts
* It only prevents **unnecessary recalculations**

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistake:

People sometimes expect this:

```js
useMemo(() => {
  console.log("This runs only on mount");
  return someValue;
}, []);
```

✅ Yes, it runs **only once**, but:

* It is **not a replacement for `useEffect`**
* It is **not meant for side effects** (like logging, fetching, DOM changes)

---

### ✅ When to use `useMemo` vs `useEffect`

| Goal                            | Use           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Run code on mount/unmount       | `useEffect`   |
| Run code when something changes | `useEffect`   |
| Cache a computed value          | `useMemo`     |
| Prevent re-creating a function  | `useCallback` |

---

### 🔄 You asked about mounting/unmounting:

| Lifecycle              | `useMemo` | `useEffect`               |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| On mount               | ✅ yes     | ✅ yes                     |
| On unmount             | ❌ no      | ✅ (with cleanup function) |
| On dependencies change | ✅ yes     | ✅ yes                     |

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

* `useMemo` **doesn't stop function calls** on mount.
* It **prevents recalculating the return value** unless dependencies change.
* For mount/unmount behavior or side effects → use `useEffect`.
