## 🔁 What Happens When You Update Something in a React Component?

Whenever you:

* Type in a form
* Click a button
* Change state using `useState`
* Receive new props

React **re-renders** the component. That means:

> **The entire function component is called again, from top to bottom.**

This is **normal behavior** in React Functional Components.

---

### ✅ Example:

```js
const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  console.log("Component rendering...");

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, every time you click the `+` button:

1. `setCount` updates the state
2. React **calls the `App()` function again**
3. You see `"Component rendering..."` printed again

---

## 🔁 Why Entire Function Executes on Every Render?

React Functional Components are just **JavaScript functions**.

* When state or props change, React **re-runs the function** to get the new JSX.
* So anything inside the function body — like `console.log`, `variables`, even function calls — **runs again**.

This is **not a bug**. React does this to keep the UI in sync with the latest state.

---

## 🧠 Now comes `useEffect` and the Dependency Array

If you write:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Effect ran");
}, [count]);
```

Then:

* This effect will **only run** when the `count` changes
* If other state changes, the effect **does not run**
* React checks the `[count]` dependency array and skips this effect if `count` hasn't changed

## ❌ Common Misunderstanding:

Many beginners think the dependency array **prevents the component from re-rendering** — this is **wrong**.

> The dependency array **only controls whether the effect logic runs**, not the component.

React will **still re-render the component** if any state or props change.

## ✅ What Dependency Array Actually Does

| Dependency Array | Meaning                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[]` (empty)     | Effect runs only once — after the first render                  |
| `[count]`        | Effect runs after the first render and whenever `count` changes |
| no array         | Effect runs on **every render** (not recommended unless needed) |

## 🔧 Visual Mental Model

Let’s say you have this:

```js
const result = useMemo(() => {
  return a + b;
}, [a, b]);
```

This means:

* The **component** still re-renders when state changes
* But the **function inside `useMemo` runs only when `a` or `b` changes**
* React **saves** (memoizes) the value and reuses it on next render

Same idea with `useEffect`:

* The code inside only runs **when needed**, based on the dependencies
* Helps avoid **unnecessary API calls**, logs, or side-effects

## 🧑‍🏫 Final Simple Explanation

> In React, whenever we change something like input, button, or state, the **whole component function runs again** — this is called a re-render.
>
> But we don't always want certain code (like API calls or expensive logic) to run every time. That's why we use **hooks like `useEffect` or `useMemo`**, and give them a **dependency array**.
>
> This tells React:
> **"Only run this part when these values actually change."**
