
# React re-renders components, re-executes functions, and how `useMemo` helps optimize performance.

---

## 🔁 What happens when a component re-renders?

In React Functional Components:

> **Every time a state or prop changes**, React **re-runs the entire component function from top to bottom**.

So if your component looks like this:

```js
const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  console.log("Component Rendered");

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
};
```

Each time you click the button:

* `setCount` updates state
* React re-renders the `App` component
* It calls `App()` again
* `console.log("Component Rendered")` runs again

---

## 🔄 So... is React slow because it runs everything again?

**No.** React is designed to do this **efficiently**. It **only updates what changed in the DOM**, thanks to the **Virtual DOM** and **reconciliation**.

But when you use:

* Expensive calculations
* Object/array creation
* API calls
  You don't want those to run unnecessarily on every render.

That’s where **hooks like `useMemo` and `useEffect`** help.

---

## 🧠 React internally tracks hook positions

Every time the component function re-runs, React:

* **Re-evaluates each hook** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, etc.)
* But thanks to internal tracking, it knows **what changed**
* React **doesn’t re-run the effect or re-calculate the memo** unless dependencies have changed

---

## 🧪 What `useMemo` really does

```js
const result = useMemo(() => {
  console.log("Calculating...");
  return expensiveFunction(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```

### What happens here?

* React still **calls the component again on every render**
* But `useMemo` tells React:

  > "Only run this function again if `a` or `b` has changed."
* So if `a` and `b` didn't change, React will use the **previous result** it cached earlier

This avoids:

* Slow calculations
* Unnecessary re-renders in child components (especially with `React.memo`)

---

## ⚠️ Common Misunderstanding

> ❌ "`useMemo` prevents the function from re-rendering"

Not quite. The **component still re-renders**, but:

* The **memoized value inside `useMemo` is reused**
* The **function inside `useMemo` is not re-executed** unless dependencies change

So `useMemo` **does not prevent re-rendering**, it **prevents re-execution of a specific computation**.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Concept                              | React Behavior                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| State or props change                | Component function re-runs                       |
| Function runs again                  | Yes, everything in body runs from top to bottom  |
| Hooks re-evaluated                   | Yes, but managed internally with stable behavior |
| `useMemo(() => ..., [deps])`         | Re-calculates only if `deps` change              |
| Prevents component from re-rendering | ❌ (use `React.memo` for that)                    |
| Prevents calculation on every render | ✅                                                |

## 🔧 Real Example

```js
const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating...");
    return count * 10000;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} value={name} />
      <p>Expensive Value: {expensiveValue}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### What happens here?

* Typing in the input changes `name`, **component re-renders**
* But `useMemo` checks: did `count` change? No.
* ✅ `Calculating...` is **NOT logged again**
* So React saves time by **not running the calculation**

## 🧑‍🏫 Final Summary (in simple words)

> In React, whenever we update state or props, the **whole component function runs again**.
> This is how React keeps the UI in sync.
> But expensive logic or functions can slow down re-renders, so we use `useMemo` to **cache the result** of those functions and avoid running them unnecessarily.
> It’s React’s way of saying:
> “Only run this when needed.”
