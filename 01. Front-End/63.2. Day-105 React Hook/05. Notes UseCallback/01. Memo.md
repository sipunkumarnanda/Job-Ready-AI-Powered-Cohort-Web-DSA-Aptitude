const App = () => {
  const [add, setAdd] = useState(0);

  const ingredients = () => {
    console.log("Recipe Ingredients Here");

# why using `memo()` helps prevent `Recipe` from re-rendering.

---

## âœ… Problem You Observed:

Every time you update `add` in `App.jsx`, React:

* Calls the `App()` function again (thatâ€™s normal)
* Re-renders the UI
* **Re-renders all child components**, including `<Recipe />`

Even though `<Recipe />` didn't receive any new props.

So you saw this in console:

```txt
Hello from Recipe component  // printed again every time you click "+"
```

---

## ðŸ§  Why Does Recipe Re-render?

By default, **React re-renders all child components whenever the parent renders**, even if:

* The childâ€™s props didn't change
* The child doesnâ€™t depend on the changing state

In your case:

```jsx
<Recipe />
```

* No props are passed
* But since `App` re-renders on `setAdd`, `Recipe` also re-renders.

---

## ðŸ§Š Solution: `memo(Recipe)`

```js
import { memo } from "react";

const Recipe = ({ ing }) => {
  console.log("Hello from Recipe component");
  return <div className='text-2xl'>Recipe</div>;
};

export default memo(Recipe);
```

### âœ… What `memo()` does:

> `React.memo` tells React:
> **"Only re-render this component if its props change."**

Since no props are passed (`<Recipe />`), and itâ€™s wrapped with `memo()`, React:

* **Skips re-rendering** `<Recipe />` when `App` re-renders
* **Uses the previous render** (cached UI)

So `console.log("Hello from Recipe component")` is **not printed again**, even if `add` changes.

## ðŸ§ª Summary

| Without `memo`                                   | With `memo`                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<Recipe />` re-renders every time `App` renders | `<Recipe />` re-renders **only when its props change** |
| Unnecessary rendering                            | Performance optimized                                  |
| Console logs on every click                      | Console logs only once                                 |

# âœ… Youâ€™ve now seen how `React.memo()` helps avoid **unwanted re-renders** of pure components that donâ€™t depend on changing props. Let me know if you want to extend this with `useCallback` or props comparison!
