> **`useCallback`** prevents **unwanted function recreation**.
> **`React.memo`** prevents **unwanted component re-rendering**.

They both help with performance optimization — but they work on **different things** and **solve different problems**.

---

## 🔹 Why is this needed in React?

Every time a React component re-renders (e.g., due to a state or props change), two things happen:

1. **All functions inside the component are re-created** (new in memory)
2. **All child components are also re-evaluated to see if they should re-render**

React is efficient, but unnecessary re-creation or re-rendering can still hurt performance, especially:

* In large applications
* With deeply nested components
* With expensive functions or calculations

---

## 🔸 `useCallback` — Prevents Unwanted Function Recreation

### 📌 Problem it solves:

Whenever your component re-renders, **all functions** declared inside it are recreated:

```js
const myFunc = () => { console.log("Hello"); }
```

Even if the logic doesn’t change, the function is **new in memory** each time.

If you:

* Pass this function as a prop to a memoized child component (`React.memo`)
* Or use it as a dependency in `useEffect`, `useMemo`, etc.

…it will **break memoization** and **cause re-renders or re-executions**.

### ✅ Solution:

```js
const myFunc = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Hello");
}, []);
```

Now:

* `myFunc` is **cached**
* It will only change if the dependencies change (in this case, never)

---

### 🧪 Example:

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const sayHello = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("Hello");
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
      <Child onClick={sayHello} />
    </>
  );
};
```

Here:

* `sayHello` is passed to `Child`
* If we didn’t use `useCallback`, `sayHello` would be **new every time**, and `Child` would **re-render even if not needed**

---

## 🔸 `React.memo` — Prevents Unwanted Component Re-rendering

### 📌 Problem it solves:

By default, **all child components re-render** when the parent re-renders — even if their props haven't changed.

```jsx
<Child title="My App" />
```

If the parent changes, `Child` re-renders too — **even if `"My App"` is the same every time**.

### ✅ Solution:

```jsx
const Child = React.memo(({ title }) => {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
});
```

Now:

* React will skip re-rendering `Child` if `title` (prop) has not changed
* It does a **shallow comparison** of props (only reference/value, not deep objects)

---

## ✅ Combined Use Case

Often, `useCallback` and `memo` are **used together**:

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const sayHello = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("Hello");
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
      <Child onClick={sayHello} />
    </>
  );
};

const Child = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Say Hello</button>;
});
```

Without `useCallback`:

* `sayHello` is new every render → `onClick` changes → `Child` re-renders

With `useCallback`:

* `sayHello` stays the same → `onClick` doesn't change → `Child` doesn't re-render

| Feature      | `useCallback`                              | `React.memo`                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Works on     | Functions                                  | Components                              |
| Purpose      | Prevents function re-creation              | Prevents component re-rendering         |
| Use case     | When passing stable functions as props     | When component props don’t change often |
| Saves what?  | Function reference                         | Component's rendered output             |
| How it works | Returns cached function unless deps change | Memoizes component unless props change  |
| When to use  | With memoized children, `useEffect`, etc.  | For pure components with stable props   |

## 🧑‍🏫 Final Real-Life Analogy

* `useCallback` is like telling React:

  > "Don’t rebuild this function every time. Just reuse it unless I change its inputs."

* `React.memo` is like telling React:

  > "Don’t redraw this component every time. Only do it when props actually change."
