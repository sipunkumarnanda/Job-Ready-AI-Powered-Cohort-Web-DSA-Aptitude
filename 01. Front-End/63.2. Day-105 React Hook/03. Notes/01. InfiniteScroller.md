## 📘 What Is an Infinite Scroller?

An **infinite scroller** is a UI pattern where content loads **dynamically as the user scrolls**, eliminating the need for pagination. As the user approaches the bottom of the content list, more items are fetched and appended.

---

## 🧠 When Is the Loader Function Called?

### ✅ In `react-infinite-scroll-component`

This is a widely used package. The key props are:

```jsx
<InfiniteScroll
  dataLength={items.length}
  next={fetchMoreData}
  hasMore={hasMore}
  loader={<h4>Loading...</h4>}
>
  {/* Your list content */}
</InfiniteScroll>
```

### 📌 `next={fetchMoreData}` – This is your loader function.

### 🔁 This `fetchMoreData` is called WHEN:

1. **User scrolls near the bottom** of the scrollable container or window.

2. The component calculates:

   ```js
   (scrollTop + clientHeight) >= (scrollHeight - threshold)
   ```

   Where:

   * `scrollTop`: how far the user has scrolled
   * `clientHeight`: visible height of container
   * `scrollHeight`: total height of content
   * `threshold`: distance from bottom (default or custom)

3. If the condition is met:

   * `next()` (your fetchMoreData) is triggered.
   * It runs your data-fetching logic (like an API call).

4. The function is **not called again** until:

   * The current fetch is complete, AND
   * `hasMore === true`.

## 💡 Key Points for Implementation

### 1. **Debounce or Throttle** (optional)

To prevent multiple triggers during fast scrolls:

```js
const fetchMoreData = useCallback(debounce(() => {
  // fetch logic
}, 200), []);
```

### 2. **Update `dataLength` Properly**

* The component tracks changes to `dataLength` (usually `items.length`).
* If it doesn’t increase, it assumes no new data was loaded — and may stop requesting more.

### 3. **Control `hasMore` Flag**

* If `hasMore` is `false`, the loader won't be called anymore.
* You must update this based on whether more data exists from your backend/API.

## 🕹️ Example: Custom Loader Triggering

If you implement infinite scroll **without a library**, your logic would look like:

```js
const handleScroll = () => {
  const { scrollTop, scrollHeight, clientHeight } = document.documentElement;
  
  if (scrollTop + clientHeight >= scrollHeight - 10 && hasMore && !loading) {
    fetchMoreData(); // ← Loader function
  }
};

useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
}, [hasMore, loading]);
```

## 🧾 Summary Notes for React Infinite Scroll Loader

| Trigger Condition     | Explanation                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Near bottom of scroll | When the scroll reaches a threshold from the bottom (usually 100px or less) |
| `hasMore === true`    | Ensures no loader call if no more data                                      |
| `dataLength` changes  | Used by libraries to confirm new data was loaded                            |
| Scrollable container  | Could be `window` or a custom `div` with overflow                           |
| Not already loading   | Prevents multiple calls during the same fetch                               |
| Unmount cleanup       | Always clean up scroll event to prevent memory leaks                        |
