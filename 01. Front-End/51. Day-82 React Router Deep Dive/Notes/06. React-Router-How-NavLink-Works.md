
## What Happens When User Clicks a Nav Link (e.g., About)?

### 1. **User Clicks `<NavLink to="/about">About</NavLink>`**

* This is a special React Router link component.
* It **prevents the default browser page reload**.
* Instead of requesting a new page from the server, React Router **intercepts the click**.

### 2. **React Router Updates the URL in the Browser**

* The URL changes from, say, `/` to `/about`.
* This happens **without refreshing the page** (client-side routing).

### 3. **React Router Matches the New URL to the Routes Defined**

* React Router looks at the `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components you defined (e.g., inside `MainRoutes.jsx`).
* It finds the `<Route path="/about" element={<About />} />` that matches `/about`.

### 4. **React Router Renders the Corresponding Component**

* React Router renders the `<About />` component inside the part of the app where `<Routes>` is placed.
* It replaces the previous component (e.g., `<Home />`) without a full page reload.

### 5. **Page Content Updates Seamlessly**

* The UI updates to show the About page content.
* The app stays fast and responsive since no server request or full page reload happens.

## Where Does This Happen in Code?

* The URL change is handled by React Router's internal history API.
* The **routes logic is in your `MainRoutes.jsx` file** where you defined:

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  {/* other routes */}
</Routes>
```

* React Router **listens to URL changes** and renders the matching component from this routing configuration.

## Summary

| Step                          | What Happens                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Click `<NavLink to="/about">` | React Router intercepts click, changes URL |
| URL changes to `/about`       | Browser URL updates without page reload    |
| Router matches route          | Finds route `/about` in your routes config |
| Router renders component      | Renders `<About />` component on the page  |

---

**So basically, clicking a nav link updates the URL, React Router matches that URL in your routing setup (like `MainRoutes.jsx`), and renders the correct component â€” all without a full page reload.**
