## 📘 Understanding `useNavigate()` in React Router

---

### 🔁 What is `useNavigate()`?

`useNavigate()` is a **hook** provided by **React Router v6** that allows you to **navigate programmatically** to different routes (pages) in your React app — **without clicking a `<Link>` or `<NavLink>`**.

---

## 🧠 Why Use `useNavigate()`?

You use it when:

* You want to **redirect** the user after a button click.
* You need to **navigate after a condition**, such as form submission or user authentication.
* You want to move to another route **without refreshing** the page.

## 🛠️ How to Use It?

### ✅ 1. **Import the Hook**

```jsx
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
```

### ✅ 2. **Call it Inside the Component**

```jsx
const navigate = useNavigate();
```

### ✅ 3. **Use It to Redirect**

```jsx
navigate("/service/detail");
```

## ✅ Your Code Explained (With Comments)

```jsx
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { themeContex } from '../context/ThemeContext'; // Assuming your context path

const Service = () => {
  // Using context to get the current theme (light or dark)
  const [theme] = useContext(themeContex);

  // Hook to navigate programmatically
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-thin m-10">Service</h1>

      {/* Button triggers navigation to /service/detail */}
      <button
        onClick={() => navigate("/service/detail")}
        className={`${
          theme === "light"
            ? "bg-gray-900 text-white"
            : "bg-white text-gray-900"
        } px-4 py-2 rounded mt-5 mr-10`}
      >
        More details
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Service;
```

---

## ✅ Output & Behavior

* When you click the **"More details"** button:

  * It calls `navigate("/service/detail")`
  * React Router **changes the route** to `/service/detail`
  * The component mapped to `/service/detail` (in your `MainRoutes.jsx`) is rendered:

    ```jsx
    <Route path="detail" element={<ServiceDetails />} />
    ```
