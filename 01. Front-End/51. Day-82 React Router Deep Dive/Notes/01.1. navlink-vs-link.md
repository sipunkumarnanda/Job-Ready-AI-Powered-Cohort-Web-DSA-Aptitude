
# ✅ Why Use `NavLink` Instead of `Link`?

### 🔹 `Link`:

* Used to **navigate** to a different route.
* Does **not** provide any indication if the link is **active** (i.e., matches the current URL).

### 🔹 `NavLink`:

* Does everything `Link` does **plus** it can automatically apply **styles or classes** when the link is **active**.
* Perfect for **navigation menus** where you want to highlight the current page.

## 🔁 Use Case Example

Let’s say you're building a navigation bar and want to highlight the active page (e.g., red color on the active link):

### ❌ Using `Link`:

```jsx
<Link to="/">Home</Link>  // No way to know if "Home" is active
```

---

### ✅ Using `NavLink` with active class:

```jsx
<NavLink 
  to="/"
  className={(e) => e.isActive ? "text-red-400" : ""}
>
  Home
</NavLink>
```

### 🔍 What happens here?

* When the user is **on `/`**, the link will have class `text-red-400` (styled red).
* If **not on `/`**, it won’t have that class.

## 💡 Why is `e.isActive` important?

The `className` function receives a special object with:

```js
{
  isActive: true/false,
  isPending: true/false
}
```

So you can customize styles **based on route match**.
