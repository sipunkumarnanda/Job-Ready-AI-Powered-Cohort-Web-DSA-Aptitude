## JavaScript Execution Process Explained in Depth  

JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous language that follows a well-defined execution process. When you run JavaScript code, it follows a systematic sequence of steps to execute instructions efficiently. Let’s break down each step in detail.

---

## **1️⃣ Global Execution Context (GEC) is Created**
Before executing any JavaScript code, the **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created. This execution context is the environment in which JavaScript code runs.

### **What is Execution Context?**
Execution Context (EC) is an environment that JavaScript creates to run the code. It contains two main phases:
- **Memory Creation Phase**
- **Code Execution Phase**

### **Types of Execution Contexts:**
1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**  
   - Created when JavaScript starts execution.
   - There is only **one** GEC per program.
   - It contains global variables and function definitions.

2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)**  
   - Created whenever a function is called.
   - Each function has its own execution context.

3. **Eval Execution Context**  
   - Created when `eval()` function is executed.
   - Rarely used.

## **2️⃣ Memory Creation Phase (Variable & Function Hoisting)**

### **What happens in this phase?**
- The JavaScript engine scans the code and **allocates memory** for all **variables and functions** **before** actually executing the code.
- This process is known as **Hoisting**.

### **How Hoisting Works?**
- **Variables declared with `var`** are **initialized as `undefined`**.
- **Function declarations** are **fully hoisted** (stored with the function body).
- **Variables declared with `let` and `const`** are hoisted but kept in a **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**, meaning they **cannot be accessed before initialization**.

### **Example:**
```javascript
console.log(x);  // undefined (hoisted)
var x = 10;

console.log(y);  // ReferenceError (TDZ)
let y = 20;

console.log(sum(5, 5));  // 10 (hoisted)
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

**Memory Allocation Table in this Phase:**
| Variable/Function | Memory Allocation |
|------------------|------------------|
| `x` (var) | `undefined` |
| `y` (let) | **Uninitialized (TDZ)** |
| `sum` (function) | `function definition` |

---

## **3️⃣ Code Execution Phase (Runs Code Line by Line)**

After memory is allocated, JavaScript starts executing the code **line by line** from **top to bottom**.

### **Steps in this phase:**
1. It replaces variables with their actual values.
2. Executes function calls.
3. Updates variables as per the assignments.

### **Example:**
```javascript
var x = 10;
let y = 20;
console.log(x + y); // 30
```

---

## **4️⃣ Call Stack Manages Function Execution**

### **What is a Call Stack?**
- The **Call Stack** is a **data structure** that keeps track of function execution.
- **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.
- When a function is called, it is **pushed** to the stack.
- When a function finishes execution, it is **popped** from the stack.

### **Example:**
```javascript
function first() {
    second();
    console.log("First function");
}
function second() {
    console.log("Second function");
}
first();
```

### **Call Stack Execution:**
1. `first()` is pushed.
2. `second()` is pushed.
3. `"Second function"` is logged.
4. `second()` is popped.
5. `"First function"` is logged.
6. `first()` is popped.

## **5️⃣ Web APIs Handle Asynchronous Tasks**

### **What are Web APIs?**
- **Web APIs** are provided by the browser (not JavaScript).
- Handles asynchronous operations like:
  - `setTimeout`
  - `setInterval`
  - `fetch`
  - DOM Manipulation
  - Event Listeners

### **Example of Web APIs Handling Asynchronous Tasks**
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```
### **Execution Flow:**
1. `"Start"` is printed.
2. `setTimeout` is sent to the **Web API section**.
3. `"End"` is printed.
4. After 2 seconds, `"Inside setTimeout"` is printed.

## **6️⃣ Microtask & Callback Queues Store Async Callbacks**

### **Microtask Queue**
- Stores:
  - **Promises**
  - **MutationObserver callbacks**
- **Executed before the Callback Queue**.

### **Callback Queue (Task Queue)**
- Stores:
  - **setTimeout, setInterval**
  - **DOM events**
- **Executed after the Microtask Queue**.

---

## **7️⃣ Event Loop Moves Tasks from Queues to Call Stack**

### **What is the Event Loop?**
- The **Event Loop** continuously checks:
  1. If the **Call Stack is empty**, it moves tasks from the **Microtask Queue** first.
  2. If the **Microtask Queue is empty**, it moves tasks from the **Callback Queue**.

### **Example with Microtasks & Callbacks**
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise resolved"));

console.log("End");
```

### **Execution Flow**
1. `"Start"` is printed.
2. `"End"` is printed.
3. **Microtask Queue:** `"Promise resolved"`
4. **Callback Queue:** `"setTimeout"`

### **Output**
```
Start
End
Promise resolved
setTimeout
```

## **8️⃣ JIT Compiler Optimizes Execution**

### **What is JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation?**
- JavaScript code is interpreted **line by line**.
- JIT **compiles** frequently used code **into machine code** for faster execution.

### **JIT Compilation Process**
1. **Interpreter (Ignition)** converts JS into bytecode.
2. **Profiler (Turbofan)** checks frequently executed code.
3. **Compiler (TurboFan + Crankshaft)** optimizes and compiles to **machine code**.

### **Diagram of JIT Compilation**
| Step | Role |
|------|------|
| Ignition | Converts JavaScript to bytecode |
| Turbofan | Optimizes frequently used code |
| Crankshaft | Converts optimized code to machine code |
