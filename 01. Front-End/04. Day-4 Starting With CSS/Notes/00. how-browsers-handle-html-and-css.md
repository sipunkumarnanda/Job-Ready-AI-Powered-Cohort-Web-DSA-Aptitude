# **How Browsers Handle HTML and CSS?**  

## **📌 Do Browsers Only Run HTML?**  
Yes, browsers are primarily **designed to read and render HTML**, as HTML forms the **structure** of a web page. However, modern browsers are also capable of **interpreting CSS and JavaScript** to enhance the appearance and functionality of web pages.  

That means:  
- Browsers **do not "run" CSS as a program** but **apply CSS styles** to HTML elements.  
- CSS works **because it is linked to an HTML document**, and the browser **parses it** to modify the look of the webpage.

## **📌 How Browsers Process HTML and CSS Together?**  
When a browser loads a webpage, it follows these steps:  

### **1️⃣ Parsing HTML**  
✔ The browser reads the **HTML document** line by line.  
✔ It creates a **DOM (Document Object Model)** tree, which represents the **structure of the page**.  

### **2️⃣ Loading and Applying CSS**  
✔ The browser checks for **CSS styles** (inline, internal, or external).  
✔ It applies CSS styles to the corresponding HTML elements.  
✔ The result is a **styled web page** that the user sees.  

### **3️⃣ Rendering the Webpage**  
✔ The browser **combines** the HTML structure and applied CSS styles.  
✔ It displays the **final styled webpage** on the screen.

## **📌 Does CSS Run Like a Program?**  
No, **CSS does not "run" like a programming language** such as JavaScript. Instead, it is:  
✔ **Read** by the browser.  
✔ **Applied** to HTML elements.  
✔ **Rendered** to modify the page’s appearance.  

🔹 Unlike JavaScript, CSS **does not contain logic, loops, or conditions** (except in CSS animations and media queries).  
🔹 CSS is a **styling language**, not a programming language.

## **📌 Example: How Browsers Apply CSS to HTML**  
### **Step 1: HTML Code**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a styled paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### **Step 2: External CSS File (`styles.css`)**
```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 32px;
    text-align: center;
}

p {
    color: green;
    font-size: 18px;
}
```

### **Step 3: What the Browser Does**
1. **Reads the HTML structure** (h1 and p elements).  
2. **Finds and loads the external CSS file**.  
3. **Applies the styles** (`h1` becomes blue and `p` becomes green).  
4. **Displays the final webpage** with applied styles.

## **📌 What If CSS is Missing?**  
If CSS is not present, the browser **still displays the HTML content**, but the page will look **plain and unstyled**.  
✔ The structure (headings, paragraphs, images) remains.  
❌ Colors, fonts, positioning, and layouts will not be applied.  

---

## **📌 Conclusion**  
✔ Browsers **only "run" HTML** but **apply** CSS because it is linked to HTML.  
✔ CSS is **not a programming language**; it **modifies the appearance** of HTML elements.  
✔ Browsers **parse HTML first**, then **apply CSS styles**, and finally **render** the webpage.  

🚀 **CSS is what makes websites visually appealing, but it works only because browsers are designed to interpret and apply it!** 🎨
