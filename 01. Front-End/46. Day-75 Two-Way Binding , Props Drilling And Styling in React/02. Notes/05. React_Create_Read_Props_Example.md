## 🔹 What Are Props in React?

### **Definition**:

**Props** (short for **properties**) are a way to **pass data from one component to another** in React, typically from a **parent to a child** component. Think of props like **arguments passed to functions**—they allow one component to send information to another.

---

## 🔹 Your Example Overview

### ✅ File: `App.jsx`

This is the **main component** that holds the **state** and passes it to two child components: `Create` and `Read`.

### ✅ File: `Create.jsx`

This child component receives `users` and `setUsers` as **props**, allowing it to:

* Read the current list of users
* Add new users via a form

### ✅ File: `Read.jsx`

This child component receives `users` as **props**, and it simply displays them.

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Flow

### ### 🔸 1. **App.jsx** — The Parent Component

```jsx
const [users, setUsers] = useState([
  {name: "Ankita", age: 20},
  {name: "Sarthak", age: 18}
])
```

* `users`: Holds an array of user objects.
* `setUsers`: Used to update the `users` state.

```jsx
<Create setUsers={setUsers} users={users} />
<Read setUsers={setUsers} users={users} />
```

* You are **passing** both `users` and `setUsers` as props to the children (`Create` and `Read`).
* This is a perfect example of how **React’s unidirectional data flow** works.

---

### 🔸 2. **Create.jsx** — Accepting and Using Props

```jsx
function Create(props) {
  const setUsers = props.setUsers;
  const users = props.users;
```

* The `Create` component receives `setUsers` and `users` as props.
* These props are now **local variables** inside this component.

#### 🧠 Local States for Form Inputs

```jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("")
const [age, setAge] = useState(18)
```

These states hold the current values from the form inputs.

#### 📩 When Form is Submitted

```jsx
const submitHandler = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const newUser = {name, age};
  setUsers([...users, newUser]);
}
```

* `e.preventDefault()` prevents the page from reloading.
* A new user object is created from form inputs.
* `setUsers([...users, newUser])` adds the new user to the **existing users array** and updates the state in the **App** component.

> ✅ Because the `users` state lives in the `App` component, changing it here updates it **everywhere** it's used—including `Read`.

---

### 🔸 3. **Read.jsx** — Reading Props and Rendering

```jsx
function Read(props) {
  const users = props.users;
```

* This component only needs to **read** the `users` array, so it only receives `users` as a prop.

#### 🔁 Rendering Users

```jsx
const renderUsers = users.map((user, index) => {
  return (
    <li key={index}>Name : {user.name} || Age : {user.age}</li>
  );
});
```

* It loops through the users array and displays each user's data inside a list item.

## 📌 Key Concepts Highlighted in This Example

### ✅ 1. **Props Usage**

* `App` sends data (`users`) and functions (`setUsers`) to child components.
* `Create` uses the props to **add** new data.
* `Read` uses the props to **display** data.

### ✅ 2. **Unidirectional Data Flow**

* Data flows **from App (parent)** ➝ to **Create and Read (children)**.
* Changes in state in `App` automatically trigger re-rendering in `Read`.

### ✅ 3. **State Lifting**

* The state is **lifted up** to the parent component (`App`) to share data between two unrelated children (`Create` and `Read`).
* This is **React's recommended pattern** for shared state.

## 🎯 Why This is a Good Example

| Feature               | Shown in Example                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Passing props         | `App ➝ Create` and `App ➝ Read` |
| Updating shared state | `setUsers` passed to children   |
| Form handling         | In `Create.jsx`                 |
| List rendering        | In `Read.jsx`                   |
| Controlled components | `input` fields tied to state    |

## 📝 Summary

* **Props** are the backbone of **component communication** in React.
* They allow **data** and **functions** to flow **from parent to child**.
* Your `App.jsx` holds the shared state and sends it via props to `Create` and `Read`.
* This keeps your app organized and your components **reusable and focused** on one task.
* **Props are read-only**, but you can use a function like `setUsers` (also passed as a prop) to change data in the parent.
