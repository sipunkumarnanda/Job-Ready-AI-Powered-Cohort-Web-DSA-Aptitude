
## 📘 Notes: AuthWrapper & Role-Based Routing in React (with Redux + React Router)

---

### ✅ What is an AuthWrapper?

**AuthWrapper** is a higher-order component (HOC) or wrapper used to **protect routes** based on the user's authentication status or role (like `admin`, `user`, or guest).

It helps control:

* **Access to routes** (e.g., only logged-in users can see their profile).
* **Role-based pages** (e.g., only admins can create products).
* **Redirecting unauthorized users** (e.g., redirect to login if not authenticated).

---

### 🔒 Why Use AuthWrapper?

* Keeps route logic clean and separated.
* Centralizes authentication checks.
* Prevents unauthorized access to restricted pages.

### 🛠️ How Does It Work?

```jsx
const AuthWrapper = ({ children, role = "user" }) => {
  const user = useSelector((state) => state.userReducer.users);

  if (!user && role === "auth") return <Navigate to="/login" />;
  if (user && role === "guest") return <Navigate to="/" />;
  if (role === "admin" && !user?.isAdmin) return <Navigate to="/" />;

  return children;
};
```

### 🔑 Role Meaning:

| Role    | Description                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `guest` | Not logged in (unauthenticated)          |
| `auth`  | Logged-in user (any role)                |
| `admin` | Only admin users (e.g., `isAdmin: true`) |

### 🧩 Using AuthWrapper with Routes

```jsx
<Route
  path="/admin/create-product"
  element={
    <AuthWrapper role="admin">
      <CreateProduct />
    </AuthWrapper>
  }
/>
```

**Other examples:**

```jsx
// Guest-only route
<AuthWrapper role="guest">
  <Login />
</AuthWrapper>

// Authenticated user route
<AuthWrapper role="auth">
  <UserProfile />
</AuthWrapper>
```

### 📁 Recommended File Structure

```
src/
│
├── AuthWrapper.jsx       # Auth logic for protecting routes
├── AppRoutes.jsx         # Central route config
├── pages/
│   ├── Login.jsx
│   ├── Register.jsx
│   ├── CreateProduct.jsx
│   └── ...
└── store/
```

---

### 🔁 Typical Role-Based Flow

1. User logs in → store `user` object (with `isAdmin`) in Redux.
2. Routes use `AuthWrapper` to check:

   * If user is logged in
   * If role matches (admin or not)
3. Unauthorized access → auto-redirect.

---

### 📝 Summary

* `AuthWrapper` improves route security and organization.
* Simplifies conditions like "only if user is logged in" or "only for admins".
* Works best when combined with Redux (for `user` state) and React Router.
