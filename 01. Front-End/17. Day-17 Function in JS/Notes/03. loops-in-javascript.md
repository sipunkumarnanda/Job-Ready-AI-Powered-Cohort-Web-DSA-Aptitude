# **Loops in JavaScript**  

Loops are an essential part of JavaScript that allow us to execute a block of code multiple times. They help automate repetitive tasks, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency. JavaScript provides several types of loops, each designed for specific use cases.  

---

## **1️⃣ What Are Loops?**  
A **loop** is a programming construct that **repeats a block of code** until a certain condition is met.  

### **🔹 Why Use Loops?**  
✅ Reduce redundant code.  
✅ Automate repetitive tasks.  
✅ Process data collections like arrays or objects efficiently.  

---

## **2️⃣ Types of Loops in JavaScript**  

| Loop Type | Used For |
|-----------|---------|
| `for` | Running a loop with a known number of iterations |
| `while` | Running a loop while a condition is true |
| `do...while` | Running a loop at least once before checking the condition |
| `forEach` | Iterating over arrays |
| `for...in` | Iterating over object properties |
| `for...of` | Iterating over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, etc. |

---

## **3️⃣ The `for` Loop**  
The **`for` loop** is used when the number of iterations is **known** beforehand.  

### **🔹 Syntax:**  
```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to execute
}
```
### **🔹 Example:**  
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration:", i);
}
```
🔹 **How It Works?**  
1. **Initialization:** `let i = 1` → A variable `i` is declared and initialized.  
2. **Condition:** `i <= 5` → The loop runs as long as `i` is **less than or equal to 5**.  
3. **Increment:** `i++` → `i` increases by `1` after each iteration.  

🟢 **Output:**  
```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
```

---

## **4️⃣ The `while` Loop**  
The **`while` loop** is used when the **number of iterations is unknown**, and the loop continues **as long as the condition is true**.  

### **🔹 Syntax:**  
```javascript
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
}
```
### **🔹 Example:**  
```javascript
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log("Iteration:", i);
    i++; // Increment i
}
```
🔹 **How It Works?**  
- The condition `i <= 5` is checked **before** each iteration.  
- If the condition is `true`, the loop runs; otherwise, it stops.  

🟢 **Output:**  
```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
```

---

## **5️⃣ The `do...while` Loop**  
The **`do...while` loop** is similar to `while`, but it ensures the loop runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false.  

### **🔹 Syntax:**  
```javascript
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```
### **🔹 Example:**  
```javascript
let i = 1;
do {
    console.log("Iteration:", i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```
🔹 **How It Works?**  
- The loop **executes first**, then checks the condition.  
- If the condition is `true`, the loop continues; otherwise, it stops.  

🟢 **Output:**  
```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
```

---

## **6️⃣ The `forEach` Loop (For Arrays)**  
The **`forEach` method** is used **only for arrays** to iterate over each element.  

### **🔹 Syntax:**  
```javascript
array.forEach((element, index) => {
    // Code to execute
});
```
### **🔹 Example:**  
```javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
fruits.forEach((fruit, index) => {
    console.log(`Index: ${index}, Fruit: ${fruit}`);
});
```
🟢 **Output:**  
```
Index: 0, Fruit: Apple
Index: 1, Fruit: Banana
Index: 2, Fruit: Cherry
```

🔹 **Why Use `forEach`?**  
✅ Cleaner syntax than a `for` loop.  
✅ No need for manual indexing.  
✅ Used for **iterating over arrays** but **cannot be stopped mid-way**.  

---

## **7️⃣ The `for...in` Loop (For Objects)**  
The **`for...in` loop** is used to iterate **over object properties**.  

### **🔹 Syntax:**  
```javascript
for (let key in object) {
    // Code to execute
}
```
### **🔹 Example:**  
```javascript
const person = { name: "John", age: 25, city: "New York" };
for (let key in person) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}
```
🟢 **Output:**  
```
name: John
age: 25
city: New York
```

🔹 **Why Use `for...in`?**  
✅ Used for **iterating over object properties**.  
✅ Can be used with arrays but **not recommended** because it includes prototype properties.  

---

## **8️⃣ The `for...of` Loop (For Iterables)**  
The **`for...of` loop** is used to iterate over **iterable objects**, such as **arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.**  

### **🔹 Syntax:**  
```javascript
for (let element of iterable) {
    // Code to execute
}
```
### **🔹 Example with Arrays:**  
```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30];
for (let num of numbers) {
    console.log(num);
}
```
🟢 **Output:**  
```
10
20
30
```
### **🔹 Example with Strings:**  
```javascript
const text = "Hello";
for (let char of text) {
    console.log(char);
}
```
🟢 **Output:**  
```
H
e
l
l
o
```

🔹 **Why Use `for...of`?**  
✅ Works with **arrays, strings, maps, sets, and other iterables**.  
✅ Provides a **cleaner way** to iterate compared to `for` and `forEach`.

## **9️⃣ Summary: Choosing the Right Loop**  

| Loop Type | Best Used For | Stops Early? |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| `for` | When the number of iterations is **known** | Yes |
| `while` | When the loop should run **until a condition is false** | Yes |
| `do...while` | When the loop should run **at least once** | Yes |
| `forEach` | Iterating over **arrays** | No |
| `for...in` | Iterating over **object properties** | No |
| `for...of` | Iterating over **iterables (arrays, strings, sets, maps, etc.)** | Yes |

## **🔟 Key Takeaways**  
✅ `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops are **general-purpose loops**.  
✅ `forEach` is **only for arrays** and **cannot be stopped early**.  
✅ `for...in` is **only for objects** and loops over **keys**.  
✅ `for...of` is used for **iterables like arrays and strings**.
