### `display: none` vs `display: block` üñ•Ô∏è

Both `display: none` and `display: block` are used in CSS to control how elements are displayed on a web page. However, they serve different purposes:

#### **`display: none`** ‚ùå
- **Purpose**: Completely removes the element from the page layout and **hides** it.
- **Effect**: The element will not take up any space in the layout, and its children (if any) are also hidden.
- **Use Case**: When you want to hide an element without removing it from the DOM (e.g., for toggling visibility with JavaScript).
- **Example**:
  ```css
  .hidden {
      display: none;
  }
  ```
  ```html
  <div class="hidden">This content is hidden</div>
  ```

  - The `<div>` won't be visible and won't affect the layout of other elements.

#### **`display: block`** üì¶
- **Purpose**: Makes the element a **block-level** element, meaning it will start on a new line and take up the full width available (by default).
- **Effect**: The element is visible, and it will occupy the entire width of its parent container, pushing other elements to the next line.
- **Use Case**: When you want an element to behave like a block element (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, or custom block elements).
- **Example**:
  ```css
  .show {
      display: block;
  }
  ```
  ```html
  <div class="show">This content is a block element</div>
  ```

  - The `<div>` will start on a new line and span the full width of its parent container.

### `inline-block` vs `block` Elements üìè

#### **`inline-block`** üñ±Ô∏è
- **Purpose**: Combines the characteristics of both `inline` and `block` elements.
- **Behavior**: 
  - The element is **inline**, so it can sit next to other elements on the same line, like text or inline elements.
  - It behaves like a block element in that you can set width, height, padding, and margins on it.
- **Use Case**: When you want an element to be inline (appear next to other elements) but still want to apply block-level styling like width and height.
- **Example**:
  ```css
  .inline-block {
      display: inline-block;
      width: 100px;
      height: 50px;
      background-color: lightblue;
  }
  ```
  ```html
  <div class="inline-block">Item 1</div>
  <div class="inline-block">Item 2</div>
  ```

  - Both `<div>` elements will appear on the same line (since `inline-block` is used), but you can still control their size with width and height.

#### **`block`** üì¶
- **Purpose**: Makes the element a **block-level** element that starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its parent container.
- **Behavior**: 
  - The element takes up the full width of its parent container.
  - It starts on a new line, pushing any following elements to the next line.
- **Use Case**: When you want an element to behave like a typical block element (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<section>`).
- **Example**:
  ```css
  .block {
      display: block;
      width: 100px;
      height: 50px;
      background-color: lightgreen;
  }
  ```
  ```html
  <div class="block">Item 1</div>
  <div class="block">Item 2</div>
  ```

  - Both `<div>` elements will appear on new lines because they are block-level elements.

### Key Differences in Behavior:

| **Property**                | **`display: none`**                               | **`display: block`**                              | **`inline-block`**                             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Visibility**               | Completely hidden, no space taken up in layout   | Visible, takes up full width of the container    | Visible, allows content to flow on the same line|
| **Space in Layout**          | No space allocated to the element                | Takes up space and pushes other elements down    | Takes space but allows elements to sit next to each other|
| **Interaction with Other Elements** | No interaction, does not affect layout    | Pushes other elements below it                  | Can sit next to other inline or inline-block elements|
| **Use Case**                 | Hiding elements dynamically (e.g., with JavaScript) | Block-level elements like sections or divs       | Inline elements with block-level styling (e.g., buttons in a row) |

### Summary:
- `**display: none**`: The element is hidden and does not occupy any space.
- `**display: block**`: The element is visible and behaves like a block-level element, taking up the full width of the parent container.
- `**inline-block**`: The element behaves like an inline element (sitting next to others), but you can apply block-level styles like width and height.

These different display properties allow you to control how elements are positioned and interact with other content on your webpage.
