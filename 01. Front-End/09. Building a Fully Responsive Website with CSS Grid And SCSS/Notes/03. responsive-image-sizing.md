When working with images in web design, it's generally considered best practice to set the **width** of an image rather than the **height**. Here's why:

### 1. **Maintaining Aspect Ratio** üìè
- When you set the **width** of an image and leave the **height** to auto, the aspect ratio (the proportional relationship between the width and height) is maintained. This ensures that the image doesn‚Äôt get distorted or stretched.
- Example:
  ```css
  img {
      width: 100%;  /* Makes the image width 100% of its container */
      height: auto; /* Automatically adjusts the height to maintain the aspect ratio */
  }
  ```

  In this case, the image will stretch or shrink in width, but the height will adjust proportionally to avoid distortion.

### 2. **Responsiveness** üì±
- By using `width` (often set as a percentage or relative unit like `vw` or `em`), you make the image more **responsive**. This means that the image will resize to fit different screen sizes, whether it's viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
- If you set both width and height, especially with fixed values (like `px`), the image may not scale properly on different devices, leading to unwanted cropping or stretching.

  Example for responsiveness:
  ```css
  img {
      width: 100%;  /* Takes up 100% of the width of its parent container */
      height: auto; /* Adjusts the height automatically */
  }
  ```

  This will ensure that the image fits within its container across various screen sizes.

### 3. **Preventing Distortion** üö´
- If you set a fixed **height** and adjust the **width** proportionally, you risk distorting the image. For example, if you force an image into a specific height without adjusting its width, it may look squished or stretched.
  
  For instance, this will distort the image:
  ```css
  img {
      width: 300px;
      height: 150px;  /* Fixed height, can distort the image */
  }
  ```

  To avoid distortion, always set `width` and let the height adjust automatically with `height: auto`.

### 4. **Flexible Layouts** üñ•Ô∏èüì±
- When creating a **fluid layout** (a design that adapts to different screen sizes), it's better to use width-based constraints because the width of the container may change based on the screen or window size.
- If you set only the width of an image, it will adapt to the container's size while maintaining the image's aspect ratio, making the layout more flexible and dynamic.

### Why **width** Over **height**?

- **Maintaining Proportions**: Setting the width ensures that the aspect ratio of the image is preserved, preventing distortion.
- **More Control in Responsiveness**: Using width allows the image to scale responsively with the screen size or container.
- **Flexibility**: It‚Äôs easier to adjust the width (especially when using percentages) to make images fit within dynamic layouts.

### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Image Example</title>
  <style>
    .image-container {
      width: 100%;
      max-width: 600px;  /* Ensures the image doesn't grow too large */
      margin: auto;
    }

    img {
      width: 100%;
      height: auto;  /* Keeps the aspect ratio intact */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400" alt="Placeholder Image">
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- The image width adjusts to 100% of its container's width.
- The height adjusts automatically to maintain the aspect ratio.
- The `max-width: 600px` ensures the image doesn't grow beyond 600px, which helps maintain good layout control.

By focusing on the **width** and letting the height adjust automatically, your images will remain proportional, responsive, and visually appealing across various screen sizes!
