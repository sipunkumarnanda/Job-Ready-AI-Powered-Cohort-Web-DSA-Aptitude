### **📌 `<!DOCTYPE html>` is NOT a Tag, It’s an Instruction**  

Many beginners assume that `<!DOCTYPE html>` is an **HTML tag**, but that's incorrect. **It is not a tag; it is an instruction to the web browser.**  

---

### **📌 What is `<!DOCTYPE html>`?**  
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` is a **document type declaration (DTD)**.  
- It tells the browser **which version of HTML** should be used to render the webpage.  
- It ensures that the browser operates in **"Standards Mode"**, instead of **"Quirks Mode"** (which can cause inconsistent webpage rendering).

### **📌 Why is `<!DOCTYPE html>` Not a Tag?**  
1️⃣ **Tags have opening (`<tag>`) and closing (`</tag>`) pairs** → `<!DOCTYPE html>` does not.  
2️⃣ **Tags define content or structure** → `<!DOCTYPE html>` is only an instruction for the browser.  
3️⃣ **Tags appear inside `<html>`** → `<!DOCTYPE html>` appears **before** `<html>`.  

✅ **Example of a Valid HTML5 Document:**  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>  <!-- This is NOT a tag, it's an instruction -->
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### **📌 What Happens if You Remove `<!DOCTYPE html>`?**  
❌ **The browser may switch to "Quirks Mode"**  
- Older rendering techniques will be used.  
- CSS and layout may not work as expected.  
- Some modern HTML5 features may not function properly.

### **📌 Conclusion**  
✅ `<!DOCTYPE html>` is **NOT a tag, but an instruction** to the browser.  
✅ It ensures that the webpage follows **modern HTML5 standards**.  
✅ Always place it at the **very top** of your HTML document.
