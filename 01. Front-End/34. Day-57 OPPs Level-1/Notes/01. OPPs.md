OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm where **objects** are used to design applications. These objects are not just data containers, but they also **contain functionality** (i.e., methods).

In JavaScript, OOP allows us to build **blueprints (classes)** for objects that will be used repeatedly, ensuring a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase.

### ðŸ”¹ Why OOP?

- âœ… To write **clean**, **organized**, and **reusable** code
- âœ… To follow **modular design** principles
- âœ… To avoid repetitive code by reusing object templates
- âœ… To better model real-world problems

### ðŸ”¹ How OOP Works in JavaScript?

#### Step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define a Class** â€“ A blueprint of the object.
2. **Add a Constructor** â€“ For initializing properties.
3. **Add Methods** â€“ Functionalities the object can perform.
4. **Create Objects (Instances)** â€“ Using the `new` keyword.

### ðŸ”¹ Example

```javascript
// 1. Define a class
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  // 2. Add method
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

// 3. Create object from class
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 30);

// 4. Use method
person1.greet(); // Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 25 years old.
person2.greet(); // Hello, my name is Bob and I'm 30 years old.
```

### ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- `class Person` is the blueprint.
- `constructor()` is automatically called when you create an object using `new`.
- `greet()` is a method bound to every object created from this class.
- `person1` and `person2` are different instances, each with its own `name` and `age`.

### ðŸ”¹ Real-Life Analogy

Think of a **class** as a **template to make cars**:

```text
Class -> Car
Objects -> BMW, Audi, Tesla
Properties -> color, speed
Methods -> drive(), brake()
```

Each car is made from the same class, but with different properties and behaviors.

### ðŸ”¹ Key OOP Concepts in JS (with future notes):

| Concept        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Class          | Blueprint for objects                                                       |
| Object         | An instance created from a class                                            |
| Constructor    | Special method for setting up new object properties                         |
| Method         | Functions defined inside the class                                          |
| Inheritance    | One class can inherit properties and methods from another class             |
| Encapsulation  | Hiding internal details, exposing only necessary parts                      |
| Polymorphism   | Objects can share methods, but behave differently based on their type       |
| Abstraction    | Hiding complexity and showing only essential features                       |
