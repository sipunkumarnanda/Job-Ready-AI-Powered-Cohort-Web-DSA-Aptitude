
## ðŸ”· What is OOPs?

Creating objects that donâ€™t just hold **data**, but also **functionality** â€” and building such objects using a **blueprint model**. Thatâ€™s basically what Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is all about.

## ðŸ”¨ What do we actually do?

We create a **class**, and from that class we create multiple **objects**.  
Each object will hold:
- some **data** (called properties),
- and some **functionalities** (called methods).  

Now, we donâ€™t have to manually write separate logic for each object â€” instead, we follow OOPs concepts to make everything **organized** and **reusable**.

## ðŸ’¡ Why do we even do it?

To write:
- **clean code**,  
- **modular code**,  
- and easily **maintainable** code.
