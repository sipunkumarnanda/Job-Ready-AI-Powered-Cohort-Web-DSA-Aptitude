
## üèóÔ∏è Constructor Functions in JavaScript

### üîç **Definition**

A **Constructor Function** in JavaScript is a special type of function that is used to create and initialize objects. When using a constructor function, the `new` keyword creates an instance of an object with properties and methods defined inside the constructor function.

Before the introduction of **ES6 Classes**, constructor functions were the primary way to create reusable objects in JavaScript.

### üèóÔ∏è **Syntax of Constructor Function**

Constructor functions are normal JavaScript functions, but with the following conventions:

1. **Start with an uppercase letter** to distinguish constructor functions from regular functions (by convention).
2. **Use the `new` keyword** to create an instance of the object.

---

### üî® **How Constructor Function Works:**

When you call a constructor function with the `new` keyword:
1. A **new empty object** is created.
2. The **`this` keyword** refers to that new object.
3. The properties and methods are added to the object.
4. The object is returned implicitly (you don't need to use `return`).

### üìå Example 1: **Creating Objects Using Constructor Function**

#### 1. **Creating a `Ghar` Object**
```js
function Ghar(){
    this.shahar = "delhi";    // Property 1: City
    this.kamre = 3;           // Property 2: Number of rooms
    this.bathroom = 2;        // Property 3: Number of bathrooms
    this.kitchen = 1;         // Property 4: Number of kitchens
}

let ghar1 = new Ghar();      // Creating a new Ghar object

console.log(ghar1);
```

#### üìã **Output:**
```js
{
    shahar: "delhi",
    kamre: 3,
    bathroom: 2,
    kitchen: 1
}
```

**Explanation**:  
- The `new Ghar()` creates a new object and initializes it with the properties `shahar`, `kamre`, `bathroom`, and `kitchen`.
- The constructor function is essentially a blueprint for the object.

#### 2. **Creating `Toffee` Objects**

```js
function Toffee(falvor, price, expiry){
    this.falvor = falvor;      // Property 1: Flavor of toffee
    this.price = price;        // Property 2: Price of toffee
    this.expiry = expiry;      // Property 3: Expiry date of toffee
}

let t1 = new Toffee("vanilla", 1.99, "01-01-2020");
console.log(t1);

let t2 = new Toffee("chocolate", 10, "02-02-2021");
console.log(t2);
```

#### üìã **Output:**
```js
Toffee { falvor: 'vanilla', price: 1.99, expiry: '01-01-2020' }
Toffee { falvor: 'chocolate', price: 10, expiry: '02-02-2021' }
```

**Explanation**:  
- The `Toffee` constructor takes parameters (`flavor`, `price`, `expiry`) and assigns them to the properties of the object created by `new Toffee()`.
- By using this constructor function, we can create multiple `Toffee` objects with different values.

## üîë **Key Points:**
- **`this` keyword**: Refers to the newly created object. Inside the constructor, we use `this` to define properties for the object.
- **`new` keyword**: Creates a new instance of the object. If you forget to use `new`, the `this` keyword will refer to the global object (in browsers, `window`), which can cause unexpected behavior.
- **No return value**: Constructor functions do not explicitly return anything. By default, they return the newly created object.

### üí° **Why Use Constructor Functions?**
1. **Reusable Code**: Constructor functions help in creating multiple instances of objects with similar structures, avoiding repetitive code.
2. **Data Encapsulation**: Encapsulates the logic of object creation inside a function, improving code maintainability and readability.
3. **Object-Oriented Design**: Constructor functions help simulate the behavior of objects in JavaScript, especially before the introduction of **ES6 Classes**.

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **Comparison to Factory Functions**:
| Feature                   | Constructor Function                         | Factory Function                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**                | Uses `new` keyword                           | Regular function                      |
| **Return Value**          | Implicitly returns `this` (new object)       | Explicitly returns a new object       |
| **Inheritance**           | Can use `prototype` for inheritance          | No inheritance unless composed       |
| **Usage**                 | Typically used with `new` keyword            | Can create objects with closures      |
| **Private Variables**     | Hard to implement private variables          | Easy to implement using closures      |

### üìù **Summary**

- **Constructor functions** provide a **standardized way** to create multiple instances of objects with predefined properties and methods.
- They are essential for **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) in JavaScript, allowing you to manage and organize data in a clean and structured way.
- Using the `new` keyword, constructor functions ensure that each object created has its own unique set of properties and methods.
