
## 🍩 Object Creation Using Constructor Functions in JavaScript

---

### 🔹 Problem Statement

If you want to create multiple objects, storing each object in a separate variable manually is not a good practice.  
Instead, we should create a **blueprint (class or constructor function)** that can generate multiple objects.  
Each object can hold its **own data**, and any shared behavior or logic can be managed through **methods**.

---

### 🔹 Solution: Constructor Function

Before `class` syntax was introduced in ES6, JavaScript used **constructor functions** to create object blueprints.

A constructor function allows you to create **multiple instances (objects)** with the same structure and behavior.

---

### 🔹 Code Example:

```javascript
// Constructor Function
function Cupcake() {
    this.name = "chocolate";
}

// Create a new object using the constructor
let a = new Cupcake();

console.log(a); // Output: Cupcake { name: 'chocolate' }
```

### 🔹 Key Concepts Behind the Code:

#### ✅ What happens when you use `new Cupcake()`?

1. **Step 1:** A brand new **blank object** is created automatically.
2. **Step 2:** The `this` keyword inside the function now refers to that **newly created blank object**.
3. **Step 3:** Properties are added to `this` — in this case, `this.name = "chocolate"` adds the name to the object.
4. **Step 4:** The newly created object is **returned automatically** (no need to use `return` manually).

### 🔹 Visual Breakdown:

| Step | Action                                 | Description                          |
|------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1    | `new Cupcake()`                        | Starts the constructor               |
| 2    | `this.name = "chocolate"`              | Adds the property to the object      |
| 3    | `console.log(a)`                       | Logs the created object              |
| 4    | Output: `Cupcake { name: "chocolate" }` | Displays object with the assigned property |

### 🔹 Mental Model:

Whenever you use `new`:
- Think: **“Create a new blank object”**.
- Inside the function: replace every `this` with that **new object**.
- Once done, return that object automatically.

---

### 🧠 Summary:

- Constructor functions are used to **create multiple similar objects**.
- The `new` keyword automatically handles the creation and return of the object.
- `this` refers to the **new object** inside the constructor.
