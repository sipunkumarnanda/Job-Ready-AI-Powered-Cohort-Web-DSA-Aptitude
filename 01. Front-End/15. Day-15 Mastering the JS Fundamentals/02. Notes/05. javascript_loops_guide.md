# **📌 Loops in JavaScript**  
Loops allow executing a block of code **multiple times** until a condition is met.  

✅ **Types of Loops in JavaScript:**  
1️⃣ **for Loop** → Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.  
2️⃣ **while Loop** → Runs as long as a condition is `true`.  
3️⃣ **do...while Loop** → Runs **at least once**, then checks the condition.

## **1️⃣ for Loop**
📌 **Best when you know how many times to loop.**  

✅ **Syntax:**  
```js
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to execute
}
```

✅ **Example:**  
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration: " + i);
}
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
1. **`let i = 1`** → Initialization (starting value).  
2. **`i <= 5`** → Condition (loop runs until `i` reaches 5).  
3. **`i++`** → Increment (`i` increases by 1 each time).

## **2️⃣ while Loop**
📌 **Best when you don’t know how many times the loop should run.**  

✅ **Syntax:**  
```js
while (condition) {
  // Code to execute
}
```

✅ **Example:**  
```js
let num = 1;

while (num <= 5) {
  console.log("Number: " + num);
  num++; // Increment
}
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- The loop **runs as long as `num <= 5`**.  
- **Inside the loop:** `num` is printed and incremented.

## **3️⃣ do...while Loop**
📌 **Runs the block at least once, then checks the condition.**  

✅ **Syntax:**  
```js
do {
  // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

✅ **Example:**  
```js
let count = 1;

do {
  console.log("Count: " + count);
  count++; 
} while (count <= 5);
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- The code runs **once**, even if `count > 5`.  
- Then it **checks the condition** (`count <= 5`).

# **📌 Special Loop Control Statements**
✔ **Break Statement:** Exits the loop **immediately** when a condition is met.  
✔ **Continue Statement:** Skips the **current iteration** and moves to the next.  

✅ **Example:**  
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue; // Skips when i = 3
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```
📌 **Output:** `1, 2, 4, 5` (3 is skipped).  

✅ **Using `break`:**  
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    break; // Stops the loop when i = 3
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```
📌 **Output:** `1, 2` (Loop stops at 3).

# **💡 Pro Teacher’s Key Takeaways**
✔ **Use `for` loops when the number of iterations is known.**  
✔ **Use `while` loops when looping until a condition is met.**  
✔ **Use `do...while` when at least one execution is required.**  
✔ **Use `break` to exit a loop early.**  
✔ **Use `continue` to skip an iteration.**
