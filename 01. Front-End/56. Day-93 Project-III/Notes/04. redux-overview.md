Redux is a **state management library** used mainly with **React** (but it can work with any JavaScript framework). It helps you manage **global state** ‚Äî i.e., data that needs to be shared across many components in a predictable and maintainable way.

### üß† Why Do We Need Redux?

In small React apps, passing state through `props` and managing it using `useState` or `useReducer` is enough.
But as the app grows, managing shared state between components becomes hard:

#### üß© Problems without Redux:

* **Prop drilling**: Passing props through many layers (parent ‚Üí child ‚Üí grandchild).
* **Scattered state logic**: Different components manage their own local state ‚Äî hard to debug.
* **Duplicate state**: Same data exists in multiple places.
* **Difficult debugging**: Hard to track what changed the state and when.

### ‚úÖ Redux Solves This With:

1. **A Central Store**
   All application state lives in a single place ‚Äî the *Redux Store*.

2. **Actions**
   Describes *what happened*. An object with a `type` and optionally a `payload`.

   ```js
   { type: "ADD_TODO", payload: "Buy milk" }
   ```

3. **Reducers**
   Pure functions that *take the old state and action*, and *return new state*.

   ```js
   const todoReducer = (state = [], action) => {
     if (action.type === "ADD_TODO") {
       return [...state, action.payload];
     }
     return state;
   }
   ```

4. **Dispatch**
   You trigger an action by calling `dispatch(action)`, and Redux sends that to the reducer.

### üåê Example Use Case:

Let‚Äôs say you are building an **e-commerce app**:

* Cart data is needed in product page, cart page, navbar (to show cart count), etc.
* Managing this with `useState` would require prop drilling.
* With Redux, you store cart data in a global store and access it from any component using `useSelector()`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Redux Toolkit (Modern Redux)

Redux used to be a bit complex with lots of boilerplate.
Now, the recommended way to write Redux logic is with **Redux Toolkit**, which:

* Simplifies reducers and action creation
* Allows direct state mutation using `Immer` behind the scenes
* Comes with built-in `createSlice`, `configureStore`, etc.

```js
import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.value += 1 },
    decrement: (state) => { state.value -= 1 }
  }
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;

const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterSlice.reducer });
```

### üß≠ When to Use Redux?

**Use Redux if:**

* Many components need access to the same data.
* App is medium-to-large scale.
* You want powerful dev tools (Redux DevTools).

**Avoid Redux if:**

* The app is small or medium and context + `useState` is enough.
* You're building a simple component tree.
