---

### üîÅ **1. What is Redux?**

Redux is a **state management library** used to manage and centralize application state, especially when your app becomes big and complex.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Core Concepts of Redux**

Redux has **3 main parts**:

| Part      | Role                                                                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Store`   | Holds the entire app state in one central place                                   |
| `Action`  | An object that tells Redux **what to do** (e.g., ADD\_USER, DELETE\_PRODUCT)      |
| `Reducer` | A function that takes the **current state and action**, and **returns new state** |

### üß≠ **3. How Redux Works (Step by Step)**

#### Let's say you want to add a product:

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: You dispatch an action

```js
dispatch({ type: 'ADD_PRODUCT', payload: { id: 1, name: "Shirt" } });
```

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Redux calls the reducer

Reducer checks the action type and updates the state accordingly.

```js
const productReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_PRODUCT':
      return [...state, action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Store is updated

Redux internally updates the `store` and notifies all components subscribed to that state.

### üßµ **4. Just Like Context, Redux Also Wraps the Whole App**

Yes! To make Redux work, you **wrap the entire application** in a special provider component:

```js
<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

> Think of `Provider` in Redux just like `Context.Provider`.

---

### üß† **5. Why Redux Instead of Multiple Contexts?**

* üîç When you use **multiple Contexts**, you often get confused:

  * Which context is parent?
  * Which child component should consume which data?
  * Nesting becomes hard to track.

* ‚úÖ With **Redux**, there's just **one central store**, and everything connects to that neatly:

  * You don‚Äôt nest providers.
  * You use `useSelector` to get data from any component.
  * You use `useDispatch` to update data from anywhere.

### üí° Summary:

| Context API                      | Redux                            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Good for small-medium apps       | Great for large & complex apps   |
| Multiple nested providers needed | Single store with global access  |
| Manual logic to update context   | Reducers handle logic cleanly    |
| No middleware                    | Has middleware (e.g., for async) |
