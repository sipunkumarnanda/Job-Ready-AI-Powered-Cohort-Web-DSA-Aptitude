## **Linking JavaScript Files Using `<script>`**  

When adding JavaScript to an HTML file, the `<script>` tag is used to link external JavaScript files or include inline scripts. However, **where and how** you place the `<script>` tag **affects page performance**.  

---

### **1. Place `<script>` Before `</body>` for Better Performance**  
Traditionally, scripts were placed in the `<head>` section, but this could slow down the page because **JavaScript execution blocks HTML rendering**.  

✅ **Best Practice:** Place `<script>` just **before the closing `</body>` tag** to ensure the HTML content loads first.  

📌 **Example:**  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Placement</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, JavaScript!</h1>

    <!-- JavaScript file is loaded at the end for better performance -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

🛠️ **Why?**  
- The **HTML content loads first**, so users **see the page faster**.  
- JavaScript executes **after the DOM is ready**, avoiding delays.

### **2. Using `defer` for Scripts That Depend on HTML Content**  
If a script **relies on HTML elements**, use the **`defer`** attribute.  

✅ **Best Practice:**  
- `defer` **loads the script in parallel** with HTML but **executes it only after the full HTML is parsed**.  
- Use `defer` when **JavaScript needs to manipulate the DOM**.  

📌 **Example:**  
```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

🛠️ **Why?**  
- Ensures JavaScript **runs only after the HTML is fully loaded**.  
- Prevents errors like `"Cannot read properties of null"` when accessing elements before they exist.  

---

### **3. Using `async` for Independent Scripts That Don’t Rely on the DOM**  
Use **`async`** for scripts that **don’t depend on the DOM** and can load independently.  

✅ **Best Practice:**  
- `async` **downloads the script while parsing HTML**, then **executes it as soon as it's ready**.  
- Use it for **analytics, ads, or third-party scripts**.  

📌 **Example:**  
```html
<script src="analytics.js" async></script>
```

🛠️ **Why?**  
- Speeds up page load time by **executing scripts as soon as they are available**.  
- Best for **scripts that don’t modify or depend on the page structure**.  

---

### **Comparison Table: `defer` vs. `async`**  

| Attribute  | When to Use? | How It Loads? | When It Runs? |
|------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **defer**  | For scripts that modify the DOM | Loads with HTML parsing | Runs after the HTML is fully loaded |
| **async**  | For independent scripts (ads, analytics) | Loads with HTML parsing | Runs immediately after loading |

---

### **Conclusion**  
- ✅ **Place `<script>` before `</body>`** for faster page load.  
- ✅ Use **`defer`** for scripts that modify the **DOM**.  
- ✅ Use **`async`** for scripts that **run independently**.  

By following these best practices, you ensure **faster, smoother, and error-free web pages**! 🚀
