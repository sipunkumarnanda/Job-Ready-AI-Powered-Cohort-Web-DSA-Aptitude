
## 📘 Event Propagation vs Event Delegation in JavaScript

---

### 🔁 1. **What is Event Propagation?**

**Event propagation** defines the order in which events are received on the DOM tree when an event (like `click`) occurs.

There are **three phases**:

1. **Capturing Phase** – The event starts at the top of the DOM and travels down to the target element.
2. **Target Phase** – The event reaches the actual target element.
3. **Bubbling Phase** – The event bubbles back up from the target to the root.

**By default, most events use the bubbling phase.**

#### 🧠 Visual Flow

```
document
  ↳ html
    ↳ body
      ↳ div
        ↳ button (clicked)
```

> Bubbling: button → div → body → html → document
> Capturing: document → html → body → div → button

---

### ✅ Example: Event Propagation

```html
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click me</button>
</div>
```

```js
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Parent clicked");
});

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Child clicked");
});
```

**Output when button is clicked:**

```
Child clicked
Parent clicked
```

This is **bubbling** in action.

### ✋ Stop Event Propagation

You can prevent bubbling using:

```js
event.stopPropagation();
```

---

### 🔄 2. **What is Event Delegation?**

**Event Delegation** is a technique in which you **attach a single event listener to a parent element**, and handle events that occur on its child elements.

> It uses **event bubbling** to catch events from child elements via the parent.

---

### ✅ Example: Event Delegation

#### HTML

```html
<ul id="menu">
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>
```

#### JavaScript

```js
document.getElementById("menu").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log("You clicked:", e.target.textContent);
  }
});
```

* Works even if `li` is added dynamically later.
* Only **1 event listener** needed.

---

### 🤯 Why Event Delegation?

1. Reduces memory usage (fewer listeners)
2. Works with dynamic content
3. Better performance for large lists (e.g., infinite scroll, tables)

### 🆚 Difference Between Event Propagation & Delegation

| Feature             | Event Propagation                         | Event Delegation                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Concept             | Flow of event (capture → target → bubble) | Handling events via parent element      |
| Phases              | Capturing, Target, Bubbling               | Relies on Bubbling                      |
| Usage               | To understand how events travel           | To optimize event handling              |
| Code Design Pattern | Event behavior                            | Event management optimization technique |
| Stop behavior?      | Yes, using `stopPropagation()`            | Not recommended unless truly needed     |

### 💡 Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case                    | Technique            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Form field validation       | Event Delegation     |
| Modal/popup outside click   | Bubbling & Capturing |
| Dynamic list click handlers | Event Delegation     |
| Stop link propagation       | stopPropagation()    |

---

### 📌 Summary

* **Event Propagation** is how events move through the DOM.
* **Event Delegation** is using a single listener on a parent to handle child events.
* Delegation **uses bubbling**, making code more efficient.
* Use `event.target` to check which element was clicked.
* Use `.stopPropagation()` if you want to block bubbling intentionally.

## 🧾 Event Propagation vs Event Delegation – Cheat Sheet

### 🔁 **Event Propagation (Phases)**

1. **Capturing Phase**:
   Event travels **top → down** (document → target element)

2. **Target Phase**:
   Event reaches the exact target element

3. **Bubbling Phase** (default):
   Event travels **bottom → up** (target → document)

---

### 📌 **Common Methods**

| Method                | Use Case                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `e.stopPropagation()` | Stops bubbling or capturing     |
| `e.preventDefault()`  | Prevents default browser action |

---

### ✅ **Example (Bubbling)**

```html
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click</button>
</div>
```

```js
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Parent");
});
document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Child");
});
```

**Output on click:**

```
Child
Parent
```

---

### 🧠 **Event Delegation**

> Attach 1 listener to a **parent**, handle events from **children** using `event.target`.

✅ Great for:

* Dynamic content
* Lists/grids/cards
* Better performance

---

### ✅ **Delegation Example**

```html
<ul id="list">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
</ul>
```

```js
document.getElementById("list").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log("Clicked:", e.target.textContent);
  }
});
```

### 🆚 **Propagation vs Delegation Summary**

| Feature       | Event Propagation        | Event Delegation               |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Concept       | How events move in DOM   | Handle child events via parent |
| Default Phase | Bubbling                 | Uses bubbling                  |
| Benefits      | Understand event order   | Fewer listeners, scalable      |
| Tools         | stopPropagation, capture | event.target + logic           |

---

### 🔥 Pro Tips

* Always use **delegation** for dynamic content (e.g., infinite scroll).
* Use `e.target.matches()` or `e.target.classList.contains()` for accuracy.
* Don’t forget `stopPropagation()` if nested clicks cause bugs.
* Prefer **capturing** only when absolutely needed.
