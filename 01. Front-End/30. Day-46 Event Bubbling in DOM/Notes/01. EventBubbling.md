---

#### 📌 **What is Event Bubbling?**

Event bubbling is a type of event propagation in the DOM where an event **starts from the target element (the one clicked)** and then **bubbles up** to its **parent**, then **grandparent**, and so on — all the way up to the root (`document`).

**Think of it like a ripple effect upward.**

---

#### 📋 **Real-Life Analogy**

Imagine dropping a ball into a bowl of water:

* The first ripple is at the center (target element).
* Then ripples go outward (parent, grandparent...).

---

#### ⚙️ **Basic Example**

```html
<div id="grandparent">
  <div id="parent">
    <button id="child">Click Me</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
document.getElementById("grandparent").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Grandparent clicked");
});

document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Parent clicked");
});

document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Child clicked");
});
```

**Output if you click the button:**

```
Child clicked
Parent clicked
Grandparent clicked
```

→ This is **event bubbling**: the event starts at the child and goes up.

#### 🛑 **How to Stop Bubbling?**

You can stop the bubbling using:

```js
event.stopPropagation();
```

This will prevent the event from reaching parent elements.

---

#### 🔁 **Event Propagation Phases (for clarity)**

There are **3 phases** of event propagation:

1. **Capturing phase** (top → down) \[rarely used]
2. **Target phase** (event reaches target)
3. **Bubbling phase** (bottom → up)

By default, event listeners are triggered during the **bubbling phase**.

---

#### 🧪 **Advanced Usage: Event Delegation with Bubbling**

Using bubbling to manage events from parent instead of each child.

```js
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.tagName === "BUTTON") {
    console.log("Button clicked:", e.target.id);
  }
});
```

→ Efficient for many child elements: you attach one event on the parent.

---

#### ✅ **When to Use Event Bubbling**

* When you want to listen to all child events from one parent.
* When dynamically creating elements (e.g. in React, Vanilla JS).
* To reduce memory usage and event listeners.

---

### 🔚 Conclusion

* **Event bubbling** is how events rise from child to parent.
* Helps in **event delegation**, **performance**, and **cleaner code**.
* Use `stopPropagation()` to prevent it.
* Use bubbling wisely to handle complex DOM interactions.
