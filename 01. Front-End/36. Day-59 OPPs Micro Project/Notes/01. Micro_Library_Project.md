
# 📚 JavaScript Object-Oriented Library Management System – In-Depth Guide

---

## 🧩 1. Overview

This program simulates a **library system** using JavaScript classes. The system lets you:
- Create books with specific details (title, author, price, ISBN).
- Maintain separate libraries, each with its own collection of books.
- Add books to libraries and view all books in each.

---

## 🏗️ 2. Core Components

### ✅ A. `Book` Class

```js
class Book {
    constructor(name, isbn, price, author) {
        this.name = name;
        this.isbn = isbn;
        this.price = price;
        this.author = author;
    }
}
```

#### 🔍 Purpose:
Encapsulates the **properties of a book**:
- `name` → Title of the book
- `isbn` → Unique identifier for the book
- `price` → Cost of the book
- `author` → Who wrote it

#### 📌 Usage Example:
```js
let b1 = new Book("Do Epic Shit", "9789354893897", 299, "Ankur Warikoo");
```

This creates an object:
```js
{
  name: "Do Epic Shit",
  isbn: "9789354893897",
  price: 299,
  author: "Ankur Warikoo"
}
```

---

### ✅ B. `Library` Class

```js
class Library {
    constructor() {
        this.books = [];
    }

    addBook(book) {
        this.books.push(book);
    }

    listAllBooks() {
        this.books.forEach((book, index) => {
            console.log(`Book ${index + 1}:`);
            console.log("Name   : ", book.name);
            console.log("ISBN   : ", book.isbn);
            console.log("Price  : ₹", book.price);
            console.log("Author : ", book.author);
            console.log("------------");
        });
    }
}
```

#### 🔍 Purpose:
Handles **book collection management**:
- `books` → An array to store book objects.
- `addBook(book)` → Adds a `Book` object to the library.
- `listAllBooks()` → Lists all books stored.

## 🔄 3. Execution Flow (Step-by-Step)

### 🔹 Step 1: Create Libraries

```js
let jhansiLibrary = new Library();
let bhopalLibrary = new Library();
```

> Each object holds its own independent `books` array.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Create Book Objects

```js
let book1 = new Book("Do Epic Shit", "9789354893897", 299, "Ankur Warikoo");
let book2 = new Book("Health is Money", "1234567890", 199, "Dr. Fit");
let book3 = new Book("Adventurous Life", "2345678901", 249, "John Doe");
let book4 = new Book("Do Something Crazy", "3456789012", 175, "Alex");
let book5 = new Book("Wealth", "4567890123", 225, "Warren Buffet");
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Add Books to Libraries

```js
jhansiLibrary.addBook(book1);
jhansiLibrary.addBook(book2);
jhansiLibrary.addBook(book3);

bhopalLibrary.addBook(book1); // Same book as Jhansi
bhopalLibrary.addBook(book4);
bhopalLibrary.addBook(book5);
```

> The same book (like `book1`) can exist in multiple libraries — it’s a shared reference.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: List All Books in Each Library

```js
jhansiLibrary.listAllBooks();
bhopalLibrary.listAllBooks();
```

#### ✅ Console Output Sample:

```
Book 1:
Name   :  Do Epic Shit
ISBN   :  9789354893897
Price  : ₹ 299
Author :  Ankur Warikoo
------------
Book 2:
Name   :  Health is Money
...
```

Each library prints its own collection.

---

## 💾 4. Memory & Object Behavior

- Every `Library` object has its **own memory space**.
- The `books[]` array is **unique per library**.
- `Book` objects are stored by **reference**, so the same book can exist in multiple libraries without duplicating its data.

## ✅ 5. Benefits of This Structure

| Feature                 | Benefit                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Object-Oriented Design | Code is modular, reusable, and maintainable                             |
| Book Encapsulation     | Book data is cleanly grouped into objects with meaningful attributes    |
| Independent Libraries  | Each library works in isolation, supporting modular growth              |
| Reference Sharing      | Memory-efficient: one book object can be used in multiple libraries     |

## 💡 6. Possible Extensions

To make this system more powerful:
- `removeBook(isbn)`
- `findBookByName(name)`
- `searchByAuthor(author)`
- `sortBooks(by = "price" | "name")`
- File/Database integration for saving data

## 🧠 Final Thought

This implementation demonstrates how you can **model real-world systems using OOP in JavaScript**. Classes like `Book` and `Library` help break problems into manageable, meaningful components, which makes your code scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand.
