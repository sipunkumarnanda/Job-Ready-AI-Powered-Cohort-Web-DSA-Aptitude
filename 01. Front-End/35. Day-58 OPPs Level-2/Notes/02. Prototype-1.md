####  **Whenever you create a constructor and you find something that is common across all instances, then putting that directly inside the constructor is not a good practice.  The correct way is to use the **prototype**, because when you save it in the prototype, all the instances created using `new` will automatically inherit that value from the prototype by default.**
---

### ‚ùå **Wrong Way ‚Äì Defining Common Property Inside Constructor**
This leads to **duplicate memory usage**, because every instance gets its own copy of the same property.

```javascript
function Toffee(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = 10; // ‚ùå This will be recreated for every instance
}

let t1 = new Toffee("Alpenliebe");
let t2 = new Toffee("Dairy Milk");

console.log(t1.price); // 10
console.log(t2.price); // 10
```

‚û°Ô∏è Here, each `Toffee` object gets a new copy of `price`, even though it's the same for all instances. That's inefficient.

---

### ‚úÖ **Correct Way ‚Äì Defining Common Property Using Prototype**
This saves memory by storing the property only **once in the prototype**, and all instances will inherit it.

```javascript
function Toffee(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

// ‚úÖ Common property defined on the prototype
Toffee.prototype.price = 10;

let t1 = new Toffee("Alpenliebe");
let t2 = new Toffee("Dairy Milk");

console.log(t1.price); // 10
console.log(t2.price); // 10
```

‚û°Ô∏è Here, `price` exists **only once** in `Toffee.prototype`, and is shared among all instances.

---

### üìå Key Takeaway:
- Use the constructor to define **unique properties** (like `name`, `age`, etc.).
- Use `prototype` to define **shared properties or methods** (like `price`, or `sayHello()`).

Great! Let's now break this down further by using **a method (function)** and showing **why putting it inside the constructor is inefficient**, and **why using the prototype is the better approach**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: Defining a Method Inside Constructor (Inefficient)

### ‚ùå Example: Method inside Constructor

```javascript
function Toffee(name) {
    this.name = name;

    // ‚ùå Method created every time a new object is created
    this.sayHello = function () {
        console.log("Hello, I am " + this.name);
    }
}

let t1 = new Toffee("Alpenliebe");
let t2 = new Toffee("Dairy Milk");

console.log(t1.sayHello === t2.sayHello); // false ‚ùóÔ∏è
```

### üö® Why avoid this?
- Every time you create a new `Toffee` object, **a new copy of the `sayHello()` function is created** in memory.
- If you create **1000 objects**, you will have **1000 copies** of the same function ‚Äì **waste of memory** and **inefficient**.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Define Method in Prototype (Efficient)

### ‚úÖ Example: Method in Prototype

```javascript
function Toffee(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

// Method shared by all Toffee instances
Toffee.prototype.sayHello = function () {
    console.log("Hello, I am " + this.name);
}

let t1 = new Toffee("Alpenliebe");
let t2 = new Toffee("Dairy Milk");

console.log(t1.sayHello === t2.sayHello); // true ‚úÖ
```

### ‚úÖ Why is this better?
- The function `sayHello` is stored **only once** in memory.
- All instances of `Toffee` **share** the same function via prototype chain.
- More **memory-efficient**, especially when many objects are created.

## üîç Summary Table

| Approach                         | Memory Usage     | Function Copies | Shared? | Recommendation |
|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| Method in Constructor            | High (inefficient) | Multiple (1 per object) | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå Avoid |
| Method in Prototype              | Low (efficient)    | Single (shared)         | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Use |

## üìå Final Thoughts:
When you're working with constructor functions:
- Use `this` for **object-specific properties**.
- Use `prototype` for **shared methods** or properties.
- This makes your code **modular, efficient**, and **scalable**.
