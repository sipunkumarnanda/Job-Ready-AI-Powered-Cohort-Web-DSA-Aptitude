---

### üî∑ Definition: What is a Constructor Function?
A **constructor function** in JavaScript is a special type of function used to create and initialize objects. When called with the `new` keyword, it:

- Creates a blank object.
- Binds `this` to the new object.
- Initializes properties/methods.
- Returns the new object implicitly.

### ‚úÖ Example Code:

```javascript
function Toffee() {
    this.name = "Harsh";
    this.sayName = function () {
        console.log("Good morning ", this.name);
    };
}

let t1 = new Toffee();
let t2 = new Toffee();

console.log(t1);
console.log(t2);
```

---

### üîç Explanation:

#### 1. **Constructor Function `Toffee()`**:
- This function sets up every `Toffee` object with:
  - A property `name` set to `"Harsh"`.
  - A method `sayName()` that prints a greeting with the object's name.

#### 2. **`this.name = "Harsh"`**:
- `this` refers to the new object being created.
- So, `name` becomes a property of that specific object.

#### 3. **`this.sayName = function() {}`**:
- This creates a **new function for every object** created via `new Toffee()`.
- That means `t1.sayName !== t2.sayName` (they are different function instances, even though they do the same thing).

#### 4. **Creating `t1` and `t2`**:
- `new Toffee()` creates new independent objects.
- Each of them has their own copy of `name` and `sayName()`.

---

### üì¶ Output:

```bash
Toffee { name: 'Harsh', sayName: [Function (anonymous)] }
Toffee { name: 'Harsh', sayName: [Function (anonymous)] }
```

Both `t1` and `t2` are individual objects with the same data and method.

### ‚ùó Important Note:
- Since `sayName()` is defined inside the constructor, a **new copy** is created for every instance. This can consume more memory.
- To **optimize memory**, use prototypes (covered in future lessons).

---

### üß† Summary:
- Constructor functions help create multiple similar objects efficiently.
- Methods can be added inside the constructor but are duplicated per instance.
- Ideal for creating instances with the same structure but different data.
