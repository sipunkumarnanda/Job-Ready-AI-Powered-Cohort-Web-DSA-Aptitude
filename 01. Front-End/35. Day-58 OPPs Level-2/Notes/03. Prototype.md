####  **Whenever you create a constructor and you find something that is common across all instances, then putting that directly inside the constructor is not a good practice.  The correct way is to use the **prototype**, because when you save it in the prototype, all the instances created using `new` will automatically inherit that value from the prototype by default.**
---

### üî∑ What Is a Prototype in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, **every function** has a special property called `.prototype`, which is an object. When you create a new object using a constructor function, this prototype object becomes the **prototype (or parent)** of the new object.

üëâ This means:
- Shared properties or methods can be added to the `.prototype` object.
- All instances created using `new` will inherit those members.
- Saves memory by **not duplicating methods** for every object.

---

### üß± Why Use `Prototype`?

Imagine you create 1000 objects using a constructor function.  
If each object has its own copy of a method, memory usage increases unnecessarily.

üîΩ Instead, if that method is defined on the constructor‚Äôs prototype:
- All instances **share** the same method.
- It‚Äôs **faster**, **leaner**, and more efficient.

---

### ‚úÖ Example 1: Defining Method via Prototype

```javascript
function Human(name, age, isHandsome) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.isHandsome = isHandsome;
}

Human.prototype.sayHello = function () {
    console.log("Hello", this.name);
};

let h1 = new Human("Harsh", 26, true);
h1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello Harsh
```

#### üîç How This Works:
- `sayHello()` is **not inside** the object.
- It‚Äôs stored in `Human.prototype`.
- When we call `h1.sayHello()`, JavaScript:
  1. Looks for `sayHello` in `h1`.
  2. Doesn‚Äôt find it.
  3. Moves to `h1.__proto__` (i.e., `Human.prototype`).
  4. Executes the method from there.

### ‚úÖ Example 2: Sharing Common Property Using Prototype

```javascript
function Toffee(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Toffee.prototype.price = 10;

let t1 = new Toffee("Kachha Aam");
console.log(t1.price);  // Output: 10
```

#### üí° Notes:
- `price` is **not inside** `t1`.
- JavaScript looks up the prototype chain and **finds it in `Toffee.prototype`**.
- `t1` gets access to `price` via inheritance.

### üîé Prototype Lookup Table (for `t1.price`)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1    | Look for `price` in `t1` ‚Üí ‚ùå Not found |
| 2    | Look in `t1.__proto__` (i.e., `Toffee.prototype`) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Found |
| 3    | Use `price = 10` from prototype |

---

### üö´ Common Mistake:

```javascript
function Toffee(name){
    this.name = name;
    this.price = 34; // ‚ùå This creates a new `price` for every instance
}
```

- Defining `price` in constructor creates **individual copies** for every object.
- Use prototype if the value is **same for all instances**.

---

### üì¶ Final Summary:

| Feature | Inside Constructor | On Prototype |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Use for | Instance-specific data | Shared methods or values |
| Memory | Creates copy per object | Shared across all |
| Access | Direct via object | Via prototype chain |
| Performance | More memory usage | Efficient and fast |

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practice:
- Use `this.property` in constructor for **unique data per object**.
- Use `Constructor.prototype.method` for **shared methods/properties**.
