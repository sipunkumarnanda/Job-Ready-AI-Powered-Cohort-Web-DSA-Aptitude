# üìò Notes on Constructor Function with `this` Keyword and Method Definition

## üß† What Is a Constructor Function?

A **constructor function** in JavaScript is used to create multiple objects with similar structure and behavior. It acts as a **blueprint** for the objects.

We use the `new` keyword with a constructor function to:
- Create a **new object**
- Set `this` to point to that new object
- Return the newly created object by default

## üîç Example Code: With Methods Inside Constructor

```javascript
function Toffee(name, price) {
    this.name = "#> " + name;         // Stored with a prefix
    this.price = price;

    this.printMyName = function() {
        console.log(name);           // Logs the original name (closure variable)
        console.log(this.name);      // Logs the prefixed name (instance property)
    }

    this.printMyPrice = function() {
        console.log(this.price);     // Logs price
    }
}

let t1 = new Toffee("kachha aam", 2);
console.log(t1);
t1.printMyName();
t1.printMyPrice();

console.log("--------------------");

let t2 = new Toffee("mango bite", 3);
console.log(t2);
t2.printMyName();
t2.printMyPrice();
```

## ‚úÖ Output Explained:

### For `t1`:
```text
Toffee { name: '#> kachha aam', price: 2, printMyName: [Function], printMyPrice: [Function] }
kachha aam          // comes from closure variable `name`
#> kachha aam        // comes from `this.name` property
2
```

### For `t2`:
```text
Toffee { name: '#> mango bite', price: 3, printMyName: [Function], printMyPrice: [Function] }
mango bite
#> mango bite
3
```

## üîç Key Concepts Explained:

### 1. `this.name = "#> " + name`
- Stores the modified name in the object.
- `this.name` is accessible as a property of the instance (e.g., `t1.name`).

### 2. `console.log(name)`
- Logs the original argument passed during object creation.
- This works due to **JavaScript closures** ‚Äî the function `printMyName` remembers the value of `name` from its outer lexical scope.

### 3. `this.printMyName = function() {...}`
- Method is defined per object.
- This is **not shared** across instances.
- Every time a new `Toffee` is created, a **new copy** of `printMyName` is created.

### 4. `this.printMyPrice = function() {...}`
- Same as above ‚Äî specific to the instance.

## ‚ùó Why Avoid Defining Methods Inside Constructor?

| Drawback                              | Description |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| üö´ Memory Inefficiency                | Each object gets its own copy of the method |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaks DRY Principle              | Duplicate code for every instance |
| üîÅ Unnecessary Repetition             | Same logic repeated in memory for each object |

### ‚úÖ Best Practice
Instead, attach such methods to the **prototype** of the constructor so all instances share the same method.

## üìå Summary Table

| Feature               | Value / Behavior                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Constructor Used     | `Toffee(name, price)`                |
| Instance Created     | `t1`, `t2`                            |
| Instance Property    | `this.name`, `this.price`             |
| Method (Per Instance)| `this.printMyName`, `this.printMyPrice` |
| Closure Used?        | ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî captures `name`              |
