When working with constructor functions in JavaScript, especially in object-oriented design, it's important to distinguish between local parameters and object properties. This distinction often comes up in the context of `name` vs `this.name`.

---

## üîç Concept Overview

### 1. **`name` (Local Parameter):**
- `name` refers to the parameter passed to the function.
- It's scoped to the function body.
- It is not automatically attached to the object being created unless you explicitly assign it.

### 2. **`this.name` (Object Property):**
- `this.name` refers to the property of the object being created via the constructor.
- It is what becomes part of the resulting object instance.
- You assign the value of the local `name` parameter to `this.name` so that each instance holds its own value.

## üß† Example for Better Understanding

```javascript
function Toffee(name, price) {
    this.name = "#> " + name; // this.name refers to the object‚Äôs property
    this.price = price;

    this.printMyName = function () {
        console.log(name);       // refers to the parameter (local variable)
        console.log(this.name);  // refers to the object‚Äôs property
    };
}

let t2 = new Toffee("mango bite", 3);
t2.printMyName();
```

---

## üìå What Happens During Execution?

### ‚û§ Object Creation:
- When `new Toffee("mango bite", 3)` is called:
  - A new empty object is created.
  - The parameter `name = "mango bite"` is available only within the function.
  - `this.name = "#> " + name` assigns a modified string to the object‚Äôs `name` property: `"#> mango bite"`.

### ‚û§ Inside `printMyName()`:
```javascript
console.log(name);       // accesses local variable ‚Üí "mango bite"
console.log(this.name);  // accesses object‚Äôs property ‚Üí "#> mango bite"
```

### ‚úÖ Output:
```
mango bite
#> mango bite
```

## üßæ Key Takeaways

| Reference      | Scope                         | Holds Value Of                | Accesses           |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| `name`         | Local to the constructor       | The argument passed to it     | Inside the function only |
| `this.name`    | Belongs to the created object  | Assigned from `name`          | Through object instance  |

---

## üõë Why This Distinction Matters?

1. **Avoid Shadowing Confusion:**
   - `name` and `this.name` are two different identifiers. Using them interchangeably without understanding leads to bugs.

2. **Object Structure Control:**
   - You must use `this.property` to ensure the property becomes part of the object and accessible later.

3. **Function Context Awareness:**
   - `this` depends on how a function is invoked. Inside constructors, `this` refers to the new object being created.

## üß™ Quick Practice

```javascript
function Car(model) {
    this.model = "üöó " + model;

    this.show = function () {
        console.log(model);       // local
        console.log(this.model);  // object
    };
}

let c = new Car("Tesla");
c.show();
```

### Output:
```
Tesla
üöó Tesla
```

## üßæ Final Thoughts

- Think of `name` as *temporary*, like a delivery package label.
- `this.name` is *permanent*, like writing the name on the package before storing it.

# üìò **Final Detailed Notes on `name` vs `this.name` in JavaScript and Lexical Scope**

---

## üîç **1. What is Lexical Scope?**

**Lexical scope (also called static scope)** means that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the **source code**.

> In JavaScript, a function **remembers** the scope in which it was created, **not where it is called**. This is the core concept of lexical scope.

### Example of Lexical Scope:

```javascript
function outer() {
    let a = 10;

    function inner() {
        console.log(a); // 10 ‚Üí Because it remembers its lexical environment
    }

    inner();
}

outer();
```

‚û°Ô∏è Here, `inner()` **remembers** `a = 10` because it was created in the **same scope** as `a`.

---

## üí° **Lexical Scope with `name` vs `this.name`**

Now, let‚Äôs apply **lexical scope** to understand the difference between `name` (local parameter) and `this.name` (object property).

```javascript
function Toffee(name, price) {
    this.name = "#> " + name; // This will be a property on the object.
    this.price = price;

    this.printMyName = function() {
        console.log(name);       // Local parameter (lexical scope)
        console.log(this.name);  // Property of the object (runtime scope)
    };
}

let t = new Toffee("Mango Bite", 2);
t.printMyName();
```

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **`name`**: This is a **local parameter** in the constructor function `Toffee`. It is stored in the **lexical scope** of the function.
2. **`this.name`**: This is an **instance property**. The `this` keyword refers to the object being created (i.e., `t` in this case). This property is accessible throughout the object's lifetime.

### Output:

```
Mango Bite        ‚Üê From lexical scope (`name`)
#> Mango Bite      ‚Üê From object property (`this.name`)
```

---

## üìò **Why is `name` accessible inside `printMyName()`?**

Since `printMyName()` is **defined inside the constructor function**, it has access to the **lexical scope** of that function. Therefore, it can access the `name` parameter directly.

> **Closure**: When the function is executed, it ‚Äúremembers‚Äù the variables from its lexical environment (in this case, the `name` parameter).

---

## üîÅ **What About `this.name`?**

`this.name` refers to a **property of the object** being created. The object itself is being created via the `new` keyword. Therefore, `this.name` refers to the property on the new object.

---

## üß™ **Visualizing Lexical Scope and `this`**

```
Global Scope
  |
  ‚Üí Toffee(name, price)
       |
       ‚Üí printMyName()  ‚Üê Has access to `name` via lexical scope
       ‚Üí this.name      ‚Üê Refers to object property created with `new Toffee()`
```

---

## üìò **What Happens If We Move `printMyName()` Outside?**

If `printMyName()` is moved outside of the constructor function, it **no longer has access to `name`** (the local parameter). However, it can still access `this.name` if called on an object.

```javascript
function Toffee(name, price) {
    this.name = "#> " + name;
    this.price = price;
}

function printMyName() {
    console.log(name);       // ‚ùå ReferenceError (name is not accessible)
    console.log(this.name);  // ‚úÖ Works if called on an object
}

let t1 = new Toffee("Kachha Aam", 2);
printMyName.call(t1);      // Prints `this.name` from object t1
```

### Explanation:
- **`name`** is only accessible within the constructor function because it is in the **lexical scope** of that function.
- **`this.name`** refers to the object's property and can be accessed anytime through the object, even if the method is moved outside.

---

## üìä **Summary of `name` vs `this.name`**

| Expression       | Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`           | **Local parameter** in the constructor's lexical scope. Accessible inside the function and methods defined within it. |
| `this.name`      | **Object property**. The `this` keyword refers to the newly created object, and this property is accessible anywhere via the object. |

---

## üìö **Final Thought:**

Understanding **lexical scope** and the difference between `name` (local variable) and `this.name` (instance property) is essential for mastering object-oriented programming in JavaScript. 

- **Lexical scope** makes it possible for inner functions to access variables from their outer scope, even when executed outside of that scope.
- **`this.name`** is dynamic and depends on the object it refers to at runtime.

Using both correctly helps in creating more organized, maintainable, and reusable code.
