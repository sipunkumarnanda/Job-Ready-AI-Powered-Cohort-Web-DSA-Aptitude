
# **detailed professional notes** on the Tailwind CSS class `line-clamp-2`:

---

## üìò What is `line-clamp-2`?

`line-clamp-2` is a **Tailwind CSS utility** (from the [line-clamp plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/line-clamp)) that limits **multiline text** to a **maximum of 2 lines** and then truncates the overflow with an ellipsis (`‚Ä¶`).

---

## üîß How to Enable It

Tailwind‚Äôs `line-clamp` is part of the **official Tailwind plugin**, so you need to install it manually unless you're using a Tailwind-based framework like Next.js (with all plugins included).

### 1. **Install the plugin** (if not already):

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/line-clamp
```

### 2. **Add it to `tailwind.config.js`:**

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/line-clamp'),
  ],
};
```

---

## ‚úÖ Usage

### Basic Example:

```jsx
<p className="line-clamp-2">
  This is a long paragraph that will be truncated after two lines. Even if there's more text, it will be hidden.
</p>
```

### What It Does:

* Limits the text to **2 visible lines**.
* Adds `‚Ä¶` at the end if the content overflows.
* Hides the rest using CSS.

| Use Case      | Why It's Useful                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product cards | Prevent inconsistent card heights from long titles/descriptions |

## üîç Behind the Scenes (CSS)

When you apply `line-clamp-2`, Tailwind uses:

```css
display: -webkit-box;
-webkit-line-clamp: 2;
-webkit-box-orient: vertical;
overflow: hidden;
```

This uses a CSS-only trick (no JS required) to clamp the number of lines.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Other Available Variants

| Class             | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `line-clamp-1`    | Truncates to 1 line (equivalent to `truncate`) |
| `line-clamp-2`    | Truncates to 2 lines                           |
| `line-clamp-3`    | ...to 3 lines                                  |

## üß™ Responsive Example

```html
<p className="line-clamp-3 md:line-clamp-2 lg:line-clamp-1">
  This text will show 3 lines on small screens, 2 lines on medium, and 1 line on large screens.
</p>
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* Only works on **block-level** or **multiline text**.
* It **doesn't animate** the clamp height.
* Works best with **fixed-width containers**.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Tips

* Always test with real content to ensure ellipsis appears as expected.
* Combine with `max-w-sm`, `w-full`, or `overflow-hidden` for better layout control.
* Ideal for **cards, previews, mobile UIs**, and clean UX design.
