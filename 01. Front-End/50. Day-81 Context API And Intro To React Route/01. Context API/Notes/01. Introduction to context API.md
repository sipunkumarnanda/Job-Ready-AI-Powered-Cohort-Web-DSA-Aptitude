
# 🌐 What is the **Context API** in React?

> The **Context API** is a built-in feature in React that allows you to share data (like state, functions, or constants) **globally** across components **without manually passing props at every level**.

---

## 🧠 Why Was Context API Introduced?

### 🔴 The Problem: **Prop Drilling**

Imagine this scenario:

```jsx
<App>
  <Parent>
    <Child>
      <GrandChild />
    </Child>
  </Parent>
</App>
```

You have a value in `<App />` that you want to access in `<GrandChild />`.

Without Context API, you'd have to do this:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const user = "Alice";

  return <Parent user={user} />;
};

const Parent = ({ user }) => {
  return <Child user={user} />;
};

const Child = ({ user }) => {
  return <GrandChild user={user} />;
};

const GrandChild = ({ user }) => {
  return <p>{user}</p>;
};
```

➡️ This is called **prop drilling** — passing props through components that **don’t even need it**, just to get it to a deeply nested component.

### 🧨 Why is prop drilling bad?

* Makes code hard to read and maintain.
* Increases coupling between components.
* Any change in the prop’s structure forces changes in all components along the chain.
* Reduces reusability of components.

## ✅ The Solution: **Context API**

With Context, we can **create a centralized "store"** that any component can access directly — **no more passing props through every layer**.

## 💡 How Context API Works — Step-by-Step

### 1. **Create Context**

```js
import { createContext } from "react";

export const UserContext = createContext(null);
```

### 2. **Provide Value Using Context.Provider**

Wrap your components at a high level:

```js
<UserContext.Provider value={"Alice"}>
  <App />
</UserContext.Provider>
```

Now every component inside `App` can access the value `"Alice"`.

### 3. **Consume Value Using useContext**

```js
import { useContext } from "react";
import { UserContext } from "./UserContext";

const GrandChild = () => {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);
  return <p>{user}</p>;
};
```

✅ No more prop drilling.
✅ Clean, readable, and scalable code.

## 🔁 Real-World Use Cases for Context API

* **Authentication:** Share user login info across app.
* **Theme toggling:** Switch between dark/light mode.
* **Language / Locale:** Internationalization (i18n).
* **Shopping Cart Data:** Share cart across pages.

---

## 🧪 Behind the Scenes: How it Works

* `createContext()` returns a Context object.
* `.Provider` component "broadcasts" the value.
* `useContext()` or `.Consumer` reads that value.
* React’s reconciliation system ensures that when the context value changes, all components using that context **automatically re-render**.

---

## 🔄 When *Not* to Use Context?

* For frequent state changes (e.g., typing in input fields) — because all components that use the context will re-render.
* For **component-local state**, like toggling modals or tracking input fields — use `useState` instead.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Feature         | With Props            | With Context API |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Prop Drilling   | Yes                   | No               |
| Reusability     | Low                   | High             |
| Maintainability | Hard                  | Easier           |
| Global Access   | Not possible directly | Easily possible  |

## 📦 Final Thought

The Context API is like a **global state locker**.
Instead of walking data from door to door (prop drilling), you just give every room a **common key** to access shared values.
