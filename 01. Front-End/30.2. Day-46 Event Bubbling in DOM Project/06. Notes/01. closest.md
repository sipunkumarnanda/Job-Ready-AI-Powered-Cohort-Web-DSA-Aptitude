---

### ✅ **What is `closest()`?**

The `Element.closest()` method **returns the closest ancestor** of the selected element (or the element itself) **that matches a given CSS selector**.

This is particularly useful when you're dealing with **event delegation** and want to find the nearest matching parent element, even if the click occurred on a child or nested element.

---

### 🧠 **Syntax**

```js
e.target.closest(selector)
```

* `e.target`: The element that triggered the event.
* `selector`: A CSS selector to match the ancestor element.

---

### 🎯 **When and Why to Use**

* In **event delegation**, when many child elements trigger the same event, but you want to perform an action only when it happened inside a specific ancestor.
* Useful to avoid assigning event listeners to many individual elements.

### 🧪 **Example**

#### ✅ HTML

```html
<ul id="list">
  <li class="item"><span>Click Me</span></li>
  <li class="item"><span>Click Me</span></li>
</ul>
```

#### ✅ JavaScript

```js
document.getElementById("list").addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  const li = e.target.closest(".item");
  if (li) {
    li.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";
    console.log("LI clicked!");
  }
});
```

✅ This works **even if you click on the `<span>` inside the `<li>`**. It will find the nearest ancestor with the class `.item`.

---

### 🚫 **Returns `null` if:**

* No matching element is found.
* The element is not in the document.

```js
let notFound = e.target.closest(".non-existent");
console.log(notFound); // null
```

---

### ⚠️ **Difference between `e.target` and `e.currentTarget`**

* `e.target`: The **actual element** that was clicked (could be deep inside).
* `e.currentTarget`: The element the **event listener is attached to**.

So we often use `e.target.closest()` to find what part of the delegated element we need to act on.

### 📌 **Real-World Use Case**

Imagine you're building a card UI and want to detect which card was clicked — even if a nested icon or image inside it was clicked:

```js
document.querySelector("#cards").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  const card = e.target.closest(".card");
  if (card) {
    console.log("Card clicked!", card);
  }
});
```
