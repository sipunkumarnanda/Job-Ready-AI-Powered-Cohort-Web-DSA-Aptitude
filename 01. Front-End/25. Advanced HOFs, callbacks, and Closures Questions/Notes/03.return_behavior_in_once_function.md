### **Understanding `return fn(...args);` in the `once` Function**  

#### **What does `return fn(...args);` do?**
In the `once` function, `return fn(...args);` **ensures that the original function `fn` is executed only once and its result is returned**.

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
```js
function once(fn) {
    let executed = false; // To track if the function has already run
    return function (...args) { // Returned function accepts any arguments
        if (!executed) { // Check if function has already been called
            executed = true; // Mark as executed
            return fn(...args); // Call the original function and return its result
        }
    };
}
```

### **How It Works**
#### **1st Call (`fn` executes and returns the result)**
```js
let greetOnce = once(function(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    return `Greeting sent to ${name}`;
});

console.log(greetOnce("Sipun"));
```
**Execution:**
- `executed` is `false`, so the condition `if (!executed)` is `true`.
- `executed` is set to `true`, ensuring that `fn` won’t run again.
- `fn(...args)` runs as `fn("Sipun")`, logging `"Hello, Sipun!"` and returning `"Greeting sent to Sipun"`.
- The `return` statement ensures that **whatever `fn` returns is passed back to the caller**.
- **Output:**
  ```txt
  Hello, Sipun!
  Greeting sent to Sipun
  ```

#### **2nd Call (`fn` does not execute, returns `undefined`)**
```js
console.log(greetOnce("Aryan"));
```
**Execution:**
- `executed` is now `true`, so the `if` block **does not run**.
- The function **exits without calling `fn`**.
- Since there's no `return` outside the `if`, it implicitly returns `undefined`.
- **Output:**
  ```txt
  undefined
  ```

### **Why `return` is Important Here**
1. **Ensures that the original function `fn` returns its result**
   - If `fn` calculates something, `return fn(...args);` ensures the caller receives the output.

2. **Works with functions that return values**
   - Example without `return`:
     ```js
     function once(fn) {
         let executed = false;
         return function (...args) {
             if (!executed) {
                 executed = true;
                 fn(...args); // No return
             }
         };
     }

     let addOnce = once((a, b) => a + b);
     console.log(addOnce(2, 3)); // Output: undefined
     ```
   - Example with `return`:
     ```js
     function once(fn) {
         let executed = false;
         return function (...args) {
             if (!executed) {
                 executed = true;
                 return fn(...args);
             }
         };
     }

     let addOnce = once((a, b) => a + b);
     console.log(addOnce(2, 3)); // Output: 5
     ```

3. **Prevents function from running more than once**
   - The `executed` flag ensures that `fn` is called only once.
   - The `return` makes sure the function behaves as expected.

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ **`return fn(...args);` ensures that the original function’s return value is preserved.**  
✅ **If `return` were missing, the function would return `undefined` after the first execution.**  
✅ **Using `return` makes the `once` function more flexible, allowing it to work with both void and returning functions.**
