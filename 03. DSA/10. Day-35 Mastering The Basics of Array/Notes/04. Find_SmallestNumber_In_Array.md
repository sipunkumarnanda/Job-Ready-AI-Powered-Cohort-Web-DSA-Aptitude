### **Finding the Minimum Element in an Array - Explanation**
---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**
1. **Take User Input for Array Size**
   ```js
   let size = Number(prompt("Enter the size of array: "));
   ```
   - The program first asks the user to enter the number of elements they want in the array.
   - `prompt()` function is used to take input as a string, and `Number()` converts it into an integer.

2. **Initialize an Empty Array**
   ```js
   let arr = new Array(size);
   ```
   - A new array of the given `size` is created.

3. **Take Input for Array Elements**
   ```js
   for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
       arr[i] = Number(prompt(`Enter the value at index ${i}: `));
   }
   console.log(arr);
   ```
   - A loop runs from `0` to `size-1`, taking user input and storing it in the array.
   - Each input value is converted into a number before storing.

4. **Initialize `min` with First Element**
   ```js
   let min = arr[0];
   ```
   - We assume the first element is the smallest.

5. **Iterate Over the Array to Find the Minimum**
   ```js
   for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
       if(arr[i] <= min){
           min = arr[i];
       }
   }
   ```
   - The loop checks every element.
   - If an element is smaller than `min`, update `min`.

6. **Display the Smallest Element**
   ```js
   console.log(`Smallest element in given array is: ${min}`);
   ```
   - Finally, the smallest element is printed.

### **Example Run**
#### **Input:**
```
Enter the size of array: 5
Enter the value at index 0: 12
Enter the value at index 1: 7
Enter the value at index 2: 15
Enter the value at index 3: 3
Enter the value at index 4: 9
```
#### **Output:**
```
[12, 7, 15, 3, 9]
Smallest element in given array is: 3
```

### **Key Takeaways**
- The array size is dynamic and taken as input.
- The first element is assumed to be the smallest initially.
- A loop compares each element to find the minimum value.
- The program efficiently finds the minimum in **O(n) time complexity**.

### **Possible Improvements**
- **Handling Negative Numbers:** Works without modification.
- **Using `Math.min()`:**  
  ```js
  let min = Math.min(...arr);
  ```
  This is a shorter way to find the minimum.
