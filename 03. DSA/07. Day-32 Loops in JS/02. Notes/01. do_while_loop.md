### **ðŸ“Œ Topic Name: Understanding the Do-While Loop in JavaScript**  

## **ðŸ”¹ What is a Do-While Loop?**  
A **do-while loop** is a type of loop in JavaScript that ensures the code inside the loop runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false.  

**Syntax:**  
```javascript
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

---

## **ðŸ”¹ How to Use a Do-While Loop?**  

âœ… The loop starts by executing the block of code inside the `do` statement.  
âœ… After executing once, it checks the `while` condition.  
âœ… If the condition is `true`, the loop continues to execute.  
âœ… If the condition is `false`, the loop stops.  

### **Example 1: Counting from 1 to 5**  
```javascript
let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```
**Output:**  
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
**Explanation:**  
- The loop runs at least **once** and keeps running **until `i` becomes greater than 5**.

## **ðŸ”¹ When to Use a Do-While Loop?**  

ðŸ”¹ **When you need the code to execute at least once, regardless of the condition.**  
ðŸ”¹ **When user input is required before checking a condition.**  

### **Example 2: Prompt User Until They Enter a Valid Number**  
```javascript
let number;
do {
    number = Number(prompt("Enter a number greater than 10:"));
} while (number <= 10);

console.log("You entered:", number);
```
**Explanation:**  
- The prompt will **always appear at least once**.  
- If the user enters a number **greater than 10**, the loop stops.  
- If not, it keeps asking for input.

## **ðŸ”¹ Key Difference Between While and Do-While Loops**
| Feature        | While Loop  | Do-While Loop  |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| Condition check | Before execution | After execution |
| Minimum executions | 0 (if condition is false) | At least 1 time |
| Best used when | Condition should be checked first | Code must run at least once |

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Summary**
- The **do-while loop** ensures the code runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false.  
- It is useful for **user input validation** and scenarios where **one-time execution is necessary** before condition checking.
