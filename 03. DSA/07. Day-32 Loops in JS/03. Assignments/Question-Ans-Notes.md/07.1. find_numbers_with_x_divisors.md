## **Topic: Finding Numbers with Exactly X Divisors**  

---

### **1. Understanding the Problem**  
The task is to find numbers that have exactly **X divisors**. A divisor of a number **N** is any number that divides **N** without leaving a remainder.

#### **Example**  
If **X = 3**, then the output should be **4, 9, 25, 49** because:
- **4** has divisors **(1, 2, 4)** → **3 divisors**
- **9** has divisors **(1, 3, 9)** → **3 divisors**
- **25** has divisors **(1, 5, 25)** → **3 divisors**
- **49** has divisors **(1, 7, 49)** → **3 divisors**

The numbers with exactly **three divisors** are squares of prime numbers.

## **2. Code Solutions with Explanation**

### **A. Finding Numbers with 3 Divisors**
#### **Logic**  
- A number has **exactly three divisors** if and only if it is the **square of a prime number**.
- Example: **4 = 2², 9 = 3², 25 = 5², 49 = 7²**
- To find such numbers, we:
  1. **Find all prime numbers** up to a certain limit.
  2. **Square each prime number** to get numbers with 3 divisors.

#### **Code Implementation**
```js
let n = 100;

function isPrime(n) {
    if (n < 2) return false;
    if (n === 2) return true;
    if (n % 2 === 0) return false;

    for (let i = 3; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i += 2) {
        if (n % i === 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

console.log("Numbers with exactly 3 divisors:");
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if (isPrime(i)) {
        console.log(i * i); // Squaring prime numbers
    }
}
```
#### **Explanation of Code**
1. **Check for prime numbers** using `isPrime()` function.
2. **Iterate through numbers from 1 to 100** to find prime numbers.
3. **Square the prime numbers** and print them as they will have exactly **three divisors**.

### **B. Finding Numbers with 4 Divisors**
#### **Logic**
- A number has **exactly four divisors** if it is the **product of two distinct prime numbers**.
- Example:  
  - **6** has divisors **(1, 2, 3, 6)**  
  - **10** has divisors **(1, 2, 5, 10)**  
  - **15** has divisors **(1, 3, 5, 15)**  
  - **35** has divisors **(1, 5, 7, 35)**  
- The approach is to iterate through numbers and count their divisors.

#### **Code Implementation**
```js
let arr = [];
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        if (i % j === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    if (count === 4) {
        arr.push(i);
    }
}

console.log("Numbers with exactly 4 divisors:", arr);
```
#### **Explanation of Code**
1. **Iterate through numbers from 1 to 100.**
2. **Count divisors for each number.**
3. **If a number has exactly 4 divisors, store it in an array.**
4. **Print all such numbers at the end.**

### **C. Finding Numbers with Any Given X Divisors**
#### **Logic**
- The user enters a value **X**, and we find numbers with exactly **X divisors**.
- This generalizes the problem to find numbers with **any specific count of divisors**.

#### **Code Implementation**
```js
let num = Number(prompt("Enter the value of X to find numbers that have exactly X divisors: "));

let arr = [];
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        if (i % j === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    if (count === num) {
        arr.push(i);
    }
}

arr.length === 0 
    ? console.log(`There are no numbers with exactly ${num} divisors.`) 
    : console.log(`Total numbers with exactly ${num} divisors: ${arr}`);
```
#### **Explanation of Code**
1. **Take input from the user** to find numbers with exactly `X` divisors.
2. **Loop through numbers from 1 to 100** and count their divisors.
3. **If the count matches `X`, store the number in an array.**
4. **Print the results.**
