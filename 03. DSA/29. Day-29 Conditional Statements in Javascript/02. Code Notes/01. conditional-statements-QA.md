# **Conditional Statements in JavaScript**  

## **Q. Accept a year and check if it is a leap year or not**  

### **What is a Leap Year?**  
A leap year is a year that has **366 days** instead of the usual **365 days**. This extra day, February 29th, occurs to keep our calendar in alignment with the Earth's revolutions around the Sun.  

### **Conditions for a Leap Year:**  
A year is a leap year if:  
✅ It is **divisible by 400**.  
✅ OR it is **divisible by 4** but **NOT by 100**.  

A year is **NOT** a leap year if:  
❌ It is **divisible by 100** but **not divisible by 400**.  

---

## **Important Concept: Year Divisible by 400**  
If a year is **divisible by 400**, it means:  
✔️ It is also **divisible by 100**.  
✔️ It is also **divisible by 4**.  

🔹 **Example Years:**  
- **1600** → Divisible by **400, 100, and 4** ✅ (Leap Year)  
- **2000** → Divisible by **400, 100, and 4** ✅ (Leap Year)  
- **2400** → Divisible by **400, 100, and 4** ✅ (Leap Year)  

Thus, we don't need to check divisibility by **100 or 4** if the year is **already divisible by 400**.  

---

## **Approach to Solve the Problem**  

### **Step 1: Check if the year is divisible by 400**  
If a year is **divisible by 400**, we can directly say it is a **leap year**, and we don’t need to check any further conditions.  

🔹 **Example Years:**  
- 1600 ✅ (Leap Year)  
- 2000 ✅ (Leap Year)  
- 2400 ✅ (Leap Year)  

---

### **Step 2: Check if the year is divisible by 4 but NOT by 100**  
If a year is **divisible by 4** and **NOT divisible by 100**, it is also a **leap year**.  

🔹 **Example Years:**  
- 2020 ✅ (Leap Year)  
- 2024 ✅ (Leap Year)  
- 2028 ✅ (Leap Year)  

---

### **Step 3: Otherwise, it is NOT a leap year**  
If a year does not satisfy any of the above conditions, it is **not a leap year**.  

🔹 **Example Years:**  
- 1700 ❌ (Not a Leap Year)  
- 1800 ❌ (Not a Leap Year)  
- 1900 ❌ (Not a Leap Year)  
- 2100 ❌ (Not a Leap Year)  

---

## **JavaScript Code Implementation**  

### **1️⃣ Using Nested `if-else` Conditions**
```js
let year = Number(prompt("Enter a Year to check if it's a Leap Year: "));

let isLeap = false;

if (year % 4 == 0) {
    if (year % 100 == 0) {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            isLeap = true;
        }
    } else {
        isLeap = true;
    }
} else {
    isLeap = false;
}

console.log(isLeap ? "Leap Year" : "Not a Leap Year");
```
✅ **Example Input:** `2000`  
✅ **Output:** `Leap Year`  

❌ **Example Input:** `1900`  
❌ **Output:** `Not a Leap Year`  

---

### **2️⃣ Optimized Code (Using Logical Operators)**
```js
let year = Number(prompt("Enter a Year to check if it's a Leap Year: "));

if (year % 400 == 0 || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0)) {
    console.log("Leap Year");
} else {
    console.log("Not a Leap Year");
}
```
✅ **Example Input:** `2024`  
✅ **Output:** `Leap Year`  

❌ **Example Input:** `2100`  
❌ **Output:** `Not a Leap Year`  

---

### **🔹 Key Takeaways**
1️⃣ If a year is **divisible by 400**, it is **automatically divisible by 100 and 4**, making it a **leap year**.  
2️⃣ If a year is **divisible by 4 but NOT by 100**, it is also a **leap year**.  
3️⃣ If a year is **divisible by 100 but NOT by 400**, it is **NOT a leap year**.  
4️⃣ The **optimized approach** reduces unnecessary conditions and improves efficiency.

# **Shop Discount Calculation in JavaScript**  

## **Concept:**  
A shop provides a discount based on the amount of purchase. The discount percentage is determined using conditional statements.

---

## **Discount Conditions:**
1. **If amount is between ₹0 - ₹5000** → **No Discount (0%)**
2. **If amount is between ₹5001 - ₹7000** → **5% Discount**
3. **If amount is between ₹7001 - ₹9000** → **10% Discount**
4. **If amount is above ₹9000** → **20% Discount**
5. **Invalid Input Handling** → If the user enters a negative amount, an error message is displayed.

---

## **Approach to Solve the Problem:**

### **Step 1: Accept user input**
- The user is asked to enter the purchase amount.
- The amount is converted into a `Number` type using `Number(prompt())`.

### **Step 2: Apply Conditional Logic**
- We use `if-else` statements to check the range in which the entered amount falls.
- Based on the range, the discount percentage is assigned to the variable `discount`.

### **Step 3: Calculate the Discounted Price**
- The total amount after the discount is calculated using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Final Price} = \text{Amount} - \left( \frac{\text{discount} \times \text{Amount}}{100} \right)
  \]
- The final amount after applying the discount is printed.

---

## **Code Implementation:**
```js
let ammount = Number(prompt("Enter Ammount : "))
let discount = 0

if(ammount >= 0 && ammount <= 5000){
    discount = 0
}else if(ammount > 5000 && ammount <= 7000){
    discount = 5
}else if(ammount > 7000 && ammount <= 9000){
    discount = 10
}else if(ammount > 9000){
    discount = 20
}else{
    console.log("Invalid input");
}

console.log(`You have to pay ${ammount - (discount * ammount)/100} after discount`);
```

---

## **Example Cases:**
| **Input (Amount in ₹)** | **Discount %** | **Final Amount (₹)** |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| ₹3000          | 0%         | ₹3000          |
| ₹6000          | 5%         | ₹5700          |
| ₹8000          | 10%        | ₹7200          |
| ₹10000         | 20%        | ₹8000          |
| -500           | Invalid    | Error Message  |

---

## **Graphical Representation:**
A bar graph representation of how the discount varies with the purchase amount:

```
Amount Range (₹)    | Discount %
--------------------|-----------
  0 - 5000         | 0%
  5001 - 7000      | 5%
  7001 - 9000      | 10%
  9001+            | 20%
```

- The discount starts from **0%** and increases as the amount increases.
- The highest discount given is **20%** for purchases above **₹9000**.

---

## **Key Takeaways:**
✅ Use `Number(prompt())` to take numeric input from the user.  
✅ Use `if-else` statements to check different ranges.  
✅ Apply a percentage discount formula to calculate the final payable amount.  
✅ Display the final amount after the discount.  
✅ Handle **invalid inputs** by checking if the entered amount is negative.  

This logic is widely used in **E-commerce** and **Retail Billing Systems** to calculate discounts dynamically. 🚀

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the **Electricity Bill Calculation** using two different approaches.

---

# 📝 **Electricity Bill Calculation in JavaScript**
Electricity bill calculations depend on **units consumed**, and the cost per unit varies based on consumption slabs. 

### **⚡ Understanding the Tariff Slabs**
- **0 - 100 units** → ₹4.2 per unit
- **101 - 200 units** → ₹6 per unit
- **201 - 400 units** → ₹8 per unit
- **Above 400 units** → ₹13 per unit

📌 **Example Calculation**
If a user consumes **250 units**, the bill is calculated as:
- First 100 units → 100 × ₹4.2 = ₹420
- Next 100 units → 100 × ₹6 = ₹600
- Remaining 50 units → 50 × ₹8 = ₹400
- **Total bill: ₹1420**

---

## 🏷️ **Approach 1: Bottom to Top Calculation (Using `if-else`)**
### **📌 Concept**
- This approach starts from the lowest **slab** and moves **upward**.
- It **adds** the corresponding bill amount **only when** the units exceed a particular slab.

### **📜 Code Implementation**
```javascript
let unit = Number(prompt("Enter unit: "));
let amount = 0;

if (unit > 0 && unit <= 100) {
    amount = unit * 4.2;
} else if (unit > 100 && unit <= 200) {
    amount = (100 * 4.2) + (unit - 100) * 6;
} else if (unit > 200 && unit <= 400) {
    amount = (100 * 4.2) + (100 * 6) + (unit - 200) * 8;
} else if (unit > 400) {
    amount = (100 * 4.2) + (100 * 6) + (200 * 8) + (unit - 400) * 13;
} else {
    console.log("Invalid Input");
}

console.log(`Your total electricity bill is: ₹${amount.toFixed(2)}`);
```

---

### **🧐 Explanation of Bottom to Top Approach**
1. **Checks range of units consumed**
   - Uses `if-else` conditions to compare `unit` and **apply correct charges**.
   
2. **Each `if` block adds up bill amount**
   - First, it calculates the bill for the first 100 units.
   - If units exceed 100, the bill for 100-200 is added.
   - If units exceed 200, the bill for 201-400 is added.
   - If units exceed 400, additional charge is applied.

3. **Why is this called Bottom to Top?**
   - It starts **from the lowest slab** and moves upwards.
   - It **compares from the base (100 units) to the highest range (>400 units).**

### **📌 Example Calculation for 250 Units**
- **100 units →** ₹4.2 × 100 = ₹420
- **Next 100 units (101-200) →** ₹6 × 100 = ₹600
- **Remaining 50 units (201-250) →** ₹8 × 50 = ₹400
- **Total = ₹420 + ₹600 + ₹400 = ₹1420**

---

## 🏷️ **Approach 2: Top to Bottom Calculation (Using Multiple `if` Statements)**
### **📌 Concept**
- This approach starts from the **highest slab** and moves **downward**.
- **Higher slabs are calculated first**, and remaining units are **updated**.

### **📜 Code Implementation**
```javascript
let unit = Number(prompt("Enter unit: "));
let amount = 0;

if (unit > 400) {
    amount += (unit - 400) * 13;
    unit = 400; // Remaining units
}
if (unit > 200 && unit <= 400) {
    amount += (unit - 200) * 8;
    unit = 200;
}
if (unit > 100 && unit <= 200) {
    amount += (unit - 100) * 6;
    unit = 100;
}
amount += (unit - 0) * 4.2; // Base 100 units

console.log(`Your total electricity bill is: ₹${amount.toFixed(2)}`);
```

---

### **🧐 Explanation of Top to Bottom Approach**
1. **Starts from the highest slab first**
   - If `unit > 400`, it calculates the **extra amount** and **reduces unit count**.
   - Moves to `200-400`, calculates charge, and **again reduces unit count**.
   - Continues till **base slab** (0-100).

2. **Why is this called Top to Bottom?**
   - It starts **from the highest slab** and reduces units **step-by-step**.
   - Each `if` block **removes used units** before moving to a lower slab.

### **📌 Example Calculation for 250 Units**
- **50 units (above 200) →** ₹8 × 50 = ₹400
- **100 units (101-200) →** ₹6 × 100 = ₹600
- **100 units (0-100) →** ₹4.2 × 100 = ₹420
- **Total = ₹420 + ₹600 + ₹400 = ₹1420**

## **📊 Comparison of Both Approaches**
| Approach  | **Logic** | **Efficiency** | **Readability** |
|-----------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Bottom to Top** | Calculates from **lower slabs to higher slabs** | More `if-else` conditions | More readable for beginners |
| **Top to Bottom** | Calculates from **higher slabs to lower slabs** | Reduces `unit` step-by-step (More optimized) | Slightly complex |

### **✅ Which Approach is Better?**
**Top to Bottom Approach** is **more optimized** because:
- It **removes unnecessary checks** by reducing `unit` step-by-step.
- It avoids **multiple `if-else` conditions**.

**Bottom to Top Approach** is **more beginner-friendly**, as it clearly calculates each slab separately.

---

## **🎯 Key Takeaways**
- **Electricity bill depends on slabs** (0-100, 101-200, etc.).
- **Approach 1 (Bottom to Top)** → Calculates **from smallest to largest slab**.
- **Approach 2 (Top to Bottom)** → **Starts from highest slab** and updates units step-by-step.
- **Top to Bottom is more efficient**, but **Bottom to Top is easier to understand**.

---

### **🔹 Example Test Cases**
| Units Consumed | Expected Bill |
|---------------|--------------|
| **50**  | ₹210.00 |
| **150** | ₹720.00 |
| **250** | ₹1420.00 |
| **450** | ₹3020.00 |

---

### **🚀 Conclusion**
Both approaches are correct, but **Top to Bottom** is more efficient. If you're a beginner, **start with Bottom to Top**, then move to **Top to Bottom for optimization**.
