# **Conditional Statements in JavaScript**  

## **Q. Accept a year and check if it is a leap year or not**  

### **What is a Leap Year?**  
A leap year is a year that has **366 days** instead of the usual **365 days**. This extra day, February 29th, occurs to keep our calendar in alignment with the Earth's revolutions around the Sun.  

### **Conditions for a Leap Year:**  
A year is a leap year if:  
✅ It is **divisible by 400**.  
✅ OR it is **divisible by 4** but **NOT by 100**.  

A year is **NOT** a leap year if:  
❌ It is **divisible by 100** but **not divisible by 400**.  

---

## **Important Concept: Year Divisible by 400**  
If a year is **divisible by 400**, it means:  
✔️ It is also **divisible by 100**.  
✔️ It is also **divisible by 4**.  

🔹 **Example Years:**  
- **1600** → Divisible by **400, 100, and 4** ✅ (Leap Year)  
- **2000** → Divisible by **400, 100, and 4** ✅ (Leap Year)  
- **2400** → Divisible by **400, 100, and 4** ✅ (Leap Year)  

Thus, we don't need to check divisibility by **100 or 4** if the year is **already divisible by 400**.  

---

## **Approach to Solve the Problem**  

### **Step 1: Check if the year is divisible by 400**  
If a year is **divisible by 400**, we can directly say it is a **leap year**, and we don’t need to check any further conditions.  

🔹 **Example Years:**  
- 1600 ✅ (Leap Year)  
- 2000 ✅ (Leap Year)  
- 2400 ✅ (Leap Year)  

---

### **Step 2: Check if the year is divisible by 4 but NOT by 100**  
If a year is **divisible by 4** and **NOT divisible by 100**, it is also a **leap year**.  

🔹 **Example Years:**  
- 2020 ✅ (Leap Year)  
- 2024 ✅ (Leap Year)  
- 2028 ✅ (Leap Year)  

---

### **Step 3: Otherwise, it is NOT a leap year**  
If a year does not satisfy any of the above conditions, it is **not a leap year**.  

🔹 **Example Years:**  
- 1700 ❌ (Not a Leap Year)  
- 1800 ❌ (Not a Leap Year)  
- 1900 ❌ (Not a Leap Year)  
- 2100 ❌ (Not a Leap Year)  

---

## **JavaScript Code Implementation**  

### **1️⃣ Using Nested `if-else` Conditions**
```js
let year = Number(prompt("Enter a Year to check if it's a Leap Year: "));

let isLeap = false;

if (year % 4 == 0) {
    if (year % 100 == 0) {
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
            isLeap = true;
        }
    } else {
        isLeap = true;
    }
} else {
    isLeap = false;
}

console.log(isLeap ? "Leap Year" : "Not a Leap Year");
```
✅ **Example Input:** `2000`  
✅ **Output:** `Leap Year`  

❌ **Example Input:** `1900`  
❌ **Output:** `Not a Leap Year`  

---

### **2️⃣ Optimized Code (Using Logical Operators)**
```js
let year = Number(prompt("Enter a Year to check if it's a Leap Year: "));

if (year % 400 == 0 || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0)) {
    console.log("Leap Year");
} else {
    console.log("Not a Leap Year");
}
```
✅ **Example Input:** `2024`  
✅ **Output:** `Leap Year`  

❌ **Example Input:** `2100`  
❌ **Output:** `Not a Leap Year`  

---

### **🔹 Key Takeaways**
1️⃣ If a year is **divisible by 400**, it is **automatically divisible by 100 and 4**, making it a **leap year**.  
2️⃣ If a year is **divisible by 4 but NOT by 100**, it is also a **leap year**.  
3️⃣ If a year is **divisible by 100 but NOT by 400**, it is **NOT a leap year**.  
4️⃣ The **optimized approach** reduces unnecessary conditions and improves efficiency.

# **Shop Discount Calculation in JavaScript**  

## **Concept:**  
A shop provides a discount based on the amount of purchase. The discount percentage is determined using conditional statements.

---

## **Discount Conditions:**
1. **If amount is between ₹0 - ₹5000** → **No Discount (0%)**
2. **If amount is between ₹5001 - ₹7000** → **5% Discount**
3. **If amount is between ₹7001 - ₹9000** → **10% Discount**
4. **If amount is above ₹9000** → **20% Discount**
5. **Invalid Input Handling** → If the user enters a negative amount, an error message is displayed.

---

## **Approach to Solve the Problem:**

### **Step 1: Accept user input**
- The user is asked to enter the purchase amount.
- The amount is converted into a `Number` type using `Number(prompt())`.

### **Step 2: Apply Conditional Logic**
- We use `if-else` statements to check the range in which the entered amount falls.
- Based on the range, the discount percentage is assigned to the variable `discount`.

### **Step 3: Calculate the Discounted Price**
- The total amount after the discount is calculated using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Final Price} = \text{Amount} - \left( \frac{\text{discount} \times \text{Amount}}{100} \right)
  \]
- The final amount after applying the discount is printed.

---

## **Code Implementation:**
```js
let ammount = Number(prompt("Enter Ammount : "))
let discount = 0

if(ammount >= 0 && ammount <= 5000){
    discount = 0
}else if(ammount > 5000 && ammount <= 7000){
    discount = 5
}else if(ammount > 7000 && ammount <= 9000){
    discount = 10
}else if(ammount > 9000){
    discount = 20
}else{
    console.log("Invalid input");
}

console.log(`You have to pay ${ammount - (discount * ammount)/100} after discount`);
```

---

## **Example Cases:**
| **Input (Amount in ₹)** | **Discount %** | **Final Amount (₹)** |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| ₹3000          | 0%         | ₹3000          |
| ₹6000          | 5%         | ₹5700          |
| ₹8000          | 10%        | ₹7200          |
| ₹10000         | 20%        | ₹8000          |
| -500           | Invalid    | Error Message  |

---

## **Graphical Representation:**
A bar graph representation of how the discount varies with the purchase amount:

```
Amount Range (₹)    | Discount %
--------------------|-----------
  0 - 5000         | 0%
  5001 - 7000      | 5%
  7001 - 9000      | 10%
  9001+            | 20%
```

- The discount starts from **0%** and increases as the amount increases.
- The highest discount given is **20%** for purchases above **₹9000**.

## **Key Takeaways:**
✅ Use `Number(prompt())` to take numeric input from the user.  
✅ Use `if-else` statements to check different ranges.  
✅ Apply a percentage discount formula to calculate the final payable amount.  
✅ Display the final amount after the discount.  
✅ Handle **invalid inputs** by checking if the entered amount is negative.  

This logic is widely used in **E-commerce** and **Retail Billing Systems** to calculate discounts dynamically. 🚀
