## 🧠 1. Stack Memory: The Foundation

### ➤ What is Stack Memory?

- **Stack Memory** is a part of memory where:
  - Function calls
  - Primitive data types (like numbers, strings)
  
  are **stored and managed** during execution.
- It follows the **LIFO** principle:
  
  > Last In, First Out — the most recently added item is removed first.

### 🧩 Characteristics of Stack:

| Feature             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structure            | Linear, Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)                                            |
| Speed                | Very fast access and allocation                                             |
| Size                 | Limited; too many function calls can lead to a **stack overflow**          |
| Stored Data          | Function calls, return addresses, primitive variables                       |
| Management           | Handled automatically by the JavaScript engine                             |

## 🧪 2. Stack with Primitive Variables

In JavaScript, primitive types are:

- `Number`
- `String`
- `Boolean`
- `Undefined`
- `Null`
- `BigInt`
- `Symbol`

➡️ These are **stored directly** in the stack.

### 📌 Example:

```js
let a = 10;   // Stored in stack
let b = a;    // b gets a copy

a = 20;
console.log(b); // 10 (unchanged)
```

🔎 **Explanation:** Primitive values are **copied by value** — changing `a` doesn't affect `b`.

## 📞 3. Call Stack in JavaScript

### ➤ What is a Call Stack?

The **Call Stack** is a part of stack memory that tracks **which function is currently executing** and **what to return to when it's done**.

### 🔄 Execution Flow:

1. Each time a function is called, it's **pushed** onto the call stack.
2. When it finishes, it’s **popped** from the call stack.

---

### 📌 Example:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
greet();
```

### 🔍 Call Stack Flow:

| Action                  | Stack Status           |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Program starts           | [ main() ]             |
| `greet()` is called      | [ main(), greet() ]    |
| `greet()` finishes       | [ main() ]             |
| Program ends             | [ ]                    |

## 🔁 4. Recursion: Function Calling Itself

### ➤ What is Recursion?

Recursion is when a function **calls itself** to solve a problem by **breaking it into smaller sub-problems**.

### ✅ Key Components:

- **Base Case:** The condition that stops recursion.
- **Recursive Case:** Function calling itself with new arguments.

---

### 🧾 Example 1: Print "Hello World" N times

```js
function printHello(n) {
    if (n === 0) return;  // Base case
    console.log("Hello World");
    printHello(n - 1);    // Recursive call
}
printHello(3);
```

🔍 **Stack Flow:**

| Function Call          | Description                |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| printHello(3)          | First call                 |
| printHello(2)          | Called from previous       |
| printHello(1)          | Called again               |
| printHello(0)          | Hits base case, returns    |

💡 Output:
```
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
```

---

### 🧾 Example 2: Print N to 1

```js
function printNumbers(n) {
    if (n === 0) return;
    console.log(n);
    printNumbers(n - 1);
}
printNumbers(5);
```

💡 Output:
```
5
4
3
2
1
```

---

### 📌 Call Stack Visualization (for `printNumbers(3)`)

| Stack State             |
|-------------------------|
| printNumbers(3)         |
| printNumbers(2)         |
| printNumbers(1)         |
| printNumbers(0) — Return |
| printNumbers(1) — Done  |
| printNumbers(2) — Done  |
| printNumbers(3) — Done  |

## ⚠️ Stack Overflow Error

Recursion must always have a **base case**. Without it, the stack keeps growing and leads to:

```
RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

## 💡 Summary Table

| Concept        | Description                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Stack Memory   | Stores primitives and tracks function calls (LIFO)       |
| Call Stack     | Tracks active/invoked functions in runtime               |
| Primitive Copy | Copied by value                                          |
| Recursion      | Function calls itself; needs a base case to terminate    |
| Stack Overflow | Happens if recursion goes infinitely without stopping    |
