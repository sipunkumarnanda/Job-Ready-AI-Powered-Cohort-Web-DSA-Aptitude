## 💡 What is the Call Stack?

The **Call Stack** is a data structure used by the JavaScript engine to **keep track of function calls**. It follows **LIFO** (Last-In-First-Out) principle.

- A function is **pushed** onto the stack when it’s called.
- Once its execution completes, it’s **popped** from the stack.
- The **top item** is called the **peak** of the stack.

## 📊 Call Stack Table (Step-by-Step Execution):

| Step | Operation       | Stack Content                     | Console Output                         |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1    | `greet()` called | `→ [ greet ]`                     | -                                      |
| 2    | Inside `greet()` | `→ [ greet ]`                     | Good morning pineapple                 |
| 3    | `fun()` called   | `→ [ greet, fun ]`                | -                                      |
| 4    | Inside `fun()`   | `→ [ greet, fun ]`                | Funning guys..........                 |
| 5    | `joke()` called  | `→ [ greet, fun, joke ]`          | -                                      |
| 6    | Inside `joke()`  | `→ [ greet, fun, joke ]`          | men and women are equal                |
| 7    | `joke()` done    | `→ [ greet, fun ]`                | -                                      |
| 8    | `fun()` done     | `→ [ greet ]`                     | -                                      |
| 9    | `greet()` done   | `→ [ ] (empty)`                   | -                                      |

### 🟣 What’s Happening Under the Hood?

```text
Start → greet() is invoked

Push greet → it logs “Good morning pineapple”
Call fun → push fun
fun logs → “Funning guys…….”
Call joke → push joke
joke logs → “men and women are equal”
joke() ends → pop joke
fun() ends → pop fun
greet() ends → pop greet
→ Stack is now empty
```

---

## ✅ Final Console Output:
```
Good morning pineapple
Funning guys..........
men and women are equal
```

## 📌 Summary:

| Term       | Meaning                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Push       | Function is called and added to the stack    |
| Pop        | Function finishes and is removed from stack  |
| Peak       | Top of the stack (currently executing func)  |

## ⚠️ Visual Tip:

Think of the Call Stack like stacking trays in a cafeteria:
- You **add** trays (push) as you go deeper.
- You **remove** trays (pop) as you return from functions.
- Only the **top tray (peak)** is visible and being worked on.
