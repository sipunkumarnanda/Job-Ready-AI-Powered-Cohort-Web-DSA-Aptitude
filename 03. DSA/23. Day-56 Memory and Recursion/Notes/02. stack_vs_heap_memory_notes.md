
## 📚 Stack and Heap Memory in JavaScript

### 🔹 What is Memory Allocation?
In JavaScript, memory is allocated to variables, data, and functions either **statically** or **dynamically**. This memory is primarily divided into two areas:
- **Stack**: Used for static memory allocation.
- **Heap**: Used for dynamic memory allocation.

## 🧱 Stack Memory

### ✅ Key Characteristics:
- **LIFO (Last In First Out)** data structure.
- Stores **primitive data types**: `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `undefined`, `null`, `BigInt`, `Symbol`.
- Also stores **function execution contexts** during function calls (Call Stack).
- **Faster access** compared to heap.
- Limited in size.

### 📦 What Goes into Stack?
- Function calls (Call Stack).
- Local variables with primitive values.
- Reference variables store memory addresses (pointers) in stack, actual object is in heap.

### 📌 Example:

```js
let x = 10;
let y = x;
y = 20;

console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // 20
```

**Explanation**:
- `x` is stored in stack with value `10`.
- `y` gets a copy of `x`'s value.
- Changing `y` doesn't affect `x` — **pass-by-value**.

## 🧠 Heap Memory

### ✅ Key Characteristics:
- Stores **objects**, **arrays**, and **functions** (non-primitive data types).
- Dynamic memory allocation.
- Slower than stack but can grow larger.
- Memory is accessed via **references** (pointers) from stack.

### 📦 What Goes into Heap?
- Objects (`{}`), Arrays (`[]`), Functions.
- Memory addresses (references) stored in stack, pointing to actual data in heap.

### 📌 Example:

```js
let user1 = { name: "Alice" };
let user2 = user1;

user2.name = "Bob";

console.log(user1.name); // Bob
```

**Explanation**:
- `user1` is an object stored in heap.
- `user2` gets the reference to the same object.
- Modifying `user2` also reflects in `user1` — **pass-by-reference**.

## ⚙️ Stack vs Heap (Comparison Table)

| Feature                | Stack                          | Heap                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Data type              | Primitive                      | Non-Primitive                    |
| Memory allocation      | Static                         | Dynamic                          |
| Access speed           | Faster                         | Slower                           |
| Storage                | Value                          | Reference                        |
| Memory size            | Limited                        | Larger                           |
| Managed by             | JavaScript Engine              | JavaScript Engine                |
| Garbage collection     | Automatic                      | Automatic                        |

## 🧵 Function Calls and Call Stack

JavaScript uses a **Call Stack** to track function execution:

### 📌 Example:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

function sayHi() {
  greet(); // pushed to call stack
  console.log("Hi");
}

sayHi(); // pushed to call stack
```

### 📊 Call Stack Trace:

1. `sayHi()` → pushed
2. `greet()` → pushed
3. `console.log("Hello")` → executed
4. `greet()` → popped
5. `console.log("Hi")` → executed
6. `sayHi()` → popped

---

## 🗑️ Garbage Collection

JavaScript uses **automatic garbage collection**:
- When objects in heap have no reference from stack, they are marked for deletion.
- Managed by the **mark-and-sweep** algorithm in JS engines like V8.

---

## 💡 Bonus Tip: Memory Leak Warning

You can accidentally cause a memory leak by keeping unnecessary references:

```js
let bigData = {};
let ref = bigData;

// If bigData is no longer needed, but ref still holds it — memory leak!
```

## ✅ Summary

| Stack                      | Heap                        |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Stores primitive data      | Stores objects, arrays      |
| Fast access                | Slower access               |
| Function call tracking     | Dynamic data allocation     |
| Automatically cleared on return | Cleared by garbage collector |
