
### Example Code: Print "Hello World" N times using Recursion

```javascript
function printHelloWorld(n) {
    if (n === 0) return;  // Base case: if n reaches 0, stop the recursion
    console.log("Hello World");
    printHelloWorld(n - 1);  // Recursive call with n reduced by 1
}

printHelloWorld(3);  // Call the function to print Hello World 3 times
```

### Call Stack Walkthrough:
When the `printHelloWorld(3)` function is called, we keep pushing new function calls to the call stack until we reach the base case (`n === 0`). Once we reach the base case, we start popping the function calls from the call stack, which allows us to print the message in the correct order.

Let's look at the **call stack** for each step and understand the **push** and **pop** actions:

---

### **Step-by-Step Call Stack**

#### **Initial Call:**
1. We call `printHelloWorld(3)`.

**Call Stack:**  
- [ `printHelloWorld(3)` ] → The first function call is pushed to the stack.

2. The function prints "Hello World" and then calls `printHelloWorld(2)`.

**Call Stack:**  
- [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)` ] → The second function call is pushed to the stack.

---

#### **Second Call (n = 2):**
3. The function prints "Hello World" and calls `printHelloWorld(1)`.

**Call Stack:**  
- [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)`, `printHelloWorld(1)` ] → The third function call is pushed to the stack.

---

#### **Third Call (n = 1):**
4. The function prints "Hello World" and calls `printHelloWorld(0)`.

**Call Stack:**  
- [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)`, `printHelloWorld(1)`, `printHelloWorld(0)` ] → The fourth function call is pushed to the stack.

---

#### **Base Case (n = 0):**
5. When `n` reaches 0, the function hits the base case and returns from the current function without making another call. This will start popping the functions off the call stack.

**Call Stack:**  
- [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)`, `printHelloWorld(1)` ] → `printHelloWorld(0)` is popped from the stack, and no new function is pushed.

6. The function `printHelloWorld(1)` returns after completing its execution.

**Call Stack:**  
- [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)` ] → `printHelloWorld(1)` is popped from the stack.

7. The function `printHelloWorld(2)` returns after completing its execution.

**Call Stack:**  
- [ `printHelloWorld(3)` ] → `printHelloWorld(2)` is popped from the stack.

8. Finally, the function `printHelloWorld(3)` returns after completing its execution.

**Call Stack:**  
- [ ] → `printHelloWorld(3)` is popped from the stack, and the call stack is empty.

### **Final Output (Printed in Console):**

```
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
```

### **Call Stack Summary:**

| Step | Function Called       | Action                                      | Call Stack                           | Output             |
|------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | `printHelloWorld(3)`   | Function called and pushed to stack        | [ `printHelloWorld(3)` ]             | -                  |
| 2    | `printHelloWorld(2)`   | Function called and pushed to stack        | [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)` ] | "Hello World"     |
| 3    | `printHelloWorld(1)`   | Function called and pushed to stack        | [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)`, `printHelloWorld(1)` ] | "Hello World"     |
| 4    | `printHelloWorld(0)`   | Base case: no further function calls, returns | [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)`, `printHelloWorld(1)`, `printHelloWorld(0)` ] | -                  |
| 5    | `printHelloWorld(0)`   | Base case hit, popped from stack           | [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)`, `printHelloWorld(1)` ] | -                  |
| 6    | `printHelloWorld(1)`   | Popped from stack                          | [ `printHelloWorld(3)`, `printHelloWorld(2)` ] | "Hello World"     |
| 7    | `printHelloWorld(2)`   | Popped from stack                          | [ `printHelloWorld(3)` ]             | "Hello World"     |
| 8    | `printHelloWorld(3)`   | Popped from stack                          | []                                   | -                  |

### **Explanation of Recursion & Call Stack in this Example:**

- **Recursion**: The function `printHelloWorld(n)` keeps calling itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case (`n === 0`), at which point it stops making further recursive calls.
  
- **Call Stack**: Every time the function calls itself recursively, a new **frame** (execution context) is pushed onto the **call stack**. Each function call has its own local variables, including `n` in this case. When the base case is met, the functions start returning, and the stack begins to unwind (pop the frames), which eventually completes the execution.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:

- Recursion is a way to break down a problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems. It uses the call stack to store intermediate function calls until the base case is reached.
- The call stack manages the order of execution for the functions.
- The function calls are pushed into the stack with each recursion and popped when the function returns.
