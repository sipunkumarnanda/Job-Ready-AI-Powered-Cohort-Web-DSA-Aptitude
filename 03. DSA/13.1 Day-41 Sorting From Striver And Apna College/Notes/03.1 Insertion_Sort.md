# **Insertion Sort Algorithm - Detailed Notes**

### **Introduction**
Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time. It works by **picking an element and placing it in its correct position** relative to the sorted portion of the array.

### **Algorithm Explanation**

1. **Start from the second element (index 1)** because the first element is trivially sorted.  
2. **Store the current element (`curr`) that needs to be placed in the correct position**.  
3. **Set `prev = i - 1`**, which represents the last element of the sorted portion of the array.  
4. **Run a while loop to shift elements**:  
   - If `arr[prev] > curr`, move `arr[prev]` one step to the right.  
   - Decrease `prev` by 1 and repeat until `arr[prev] ≤ curr` or `prev < 0`.  
5. **Insert `curr` at `arr[prev + 1]`** to place it in its correct position.  
6. **Repeat the process for all elements until the entire array is sorted**.

### **Explanation**

### **Iteration 1 (`i = 1`)**  
**Initial State:**
- Current element (`curr = arr[i] = 1`)
- Previous index (`prev = i - 1 = 0`)

**Comparison & Shifting:**
- Compare `arr[prev] = 4` with `curr = 1`:
  - Since `4 > 1`, we need to shift `4` one position to the right:  
    - `arr[prev + 1] = arr[prev]` → `arr[1] = arr[0]` (array becomes `[4, 4, 5, 2, 3]`)
  - Decrease `prev` by 1 (`prev--`) → `prev = -1`.  
    - **Why `prev--`?** This moves `prev` to -1, indicating that we've reached the beginning of the array. At this point, there are no more elements to compare, so we stop the shifting process.

**Insertion:**
- Since `prev = -1`, it means there are no more elements left to compare.  
- Insert `curr` (1) at the correct position (`arr[prev + 1]`):  
  - `arr[0] = 1`  
- **Array after Iteration 1:**  
  - The array becomes: `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`

### **Iteration 2 (`i = 2`)**  
**Initial State:**
- Current element (`curr = arr[i] = 5`)
- Previous index (`prev = i - 1 = 1`)

**Comparison & Shifting:**
- Compare `arr[prev] = 4` with `curr = 5`:
  - Since `4 < 5`, no shifting is needed, and we can directly move to the next step.

**Insertion:**
- Since `curr = 5` is already in the correct position, no changes are made to the array.

**Why `prev--` is not required here:**
- Since `4 < 5`, no shift is made, so we don't need to decrement `prev`. We move directly to insertion.

**Array remains the same:**
- The array remains: `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`

### **Iteration 3 (`i = 3`)**  
**Initial State:**
- Current element (`curr = arr[i] = 2`)
- Previous index (`prev = i - 1 = 2`)

**Comparison & Shifting:**
- Compare `arr[prev] = 5` with `curr = 2`:
  - Since `5 > 2`, we need to shift `5` one position to the right:  
    - `arr[prev + 1] = arr[prev]` → `arr[3] = arr[2]` (array becomes `[1, 4, 5, 5, 3]`)
  - Decrease `prev` by 1 (`prev--`) → `prev = 1`
- Compare `arr[prev] = 4` with `curr = 2`:
  - Since `4 > 2`, we need to shift `4` one position to the right:  
    - `arr[prev + 1] = arr[prev]` → `arr[2] = arr[1]` (array becomes `[1, 4, 4, 5, 3]`)
  - Decrease `prev` by 1 (`prev--`) → `prev = 0`
- Compare `arr[prev] = 1` with `curr = 2`:
  - Since `1 < 2`, we stop the shifting process.

**Insertion:**
- Insert `curr` (2) at the correct position (`arr[prev + 1]`):  
  - `arr[1] = 2`  
- **Array after Iteration 3:**  
  - The array becomes: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]`

### **Iteration 4 (`i = 4`)**  
**Initial State:**
- Current element (`curr = arr[i] = 3`)
- Previous index (`prev = i - 1 = 3`)

**Comparison & Shifting:**
- Compare `arr[prev] = 5` with `curr = 3`:
  - Since `5 > 3`, we need to shift `5` one position to the right:  
    - `arr[prev + 1] = arr[prev]` → `arr[4] = arr[3]` (array becomes `[1, 2, 4, 5, 5]`)
  - Decrease `prev` by 1 (`prev--`) → `prev = 2`
- Compare `arr[prev] = 4` with `curr = 3`:
  - Since `4 > 3`, we need to shift `4` one position to the right:  
    - `arr[prev + 1] = arr[prev]` → `arr[3] = arr[2]` (array becomes `[1, 2, 4, 4, 5]`)
  - Decrease `prev` by 1 (`prev--`) → `prev = 1`
- Compare `arr[prev] = 2` with `curr = 3`:
  - Since `2 < 3`, we stop the shifting process.

**Insertion:**
- Insert `curr` (3) at the correct position (`arr[prev + 1]`):  
  - `arr[2] = 3`  
- **Array after Iteration 4:**  
  - The array becomes: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

### **Final Sorted Array:**  
- The sorted array is: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

---

### **Key Points to Remember:**
- **`prev = i - 1`**: The previous index is always `i - 1`, where `i` is the current index. This ensures that we're comparing the current element (`curr`) with the last element of the sorted portion of the array.
  
- **Shifting Elements**: We compare the current element with elements in the sorted portion and shift them to the right if they're greater than `curr`. The `prev--` helps us move backward through the sorted portion to find the correct position for `curr`.

- **Insertion**: Once we've identified the correct position (when `prev` is no longer greater than `curr`), we insert the current element at `arr[prev + 1]` to ensure that `curr` is placed at the right spot in the sorted portion.
