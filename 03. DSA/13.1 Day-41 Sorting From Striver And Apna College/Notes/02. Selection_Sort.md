## **Selection Sort Algorithm - Detailed Notes**

### **Introduction**
Selection Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first element of that portion. The process continues until the entire array is sorted.

### **Algorithm Explanation**
1. **Set a loop to track the sorting range**:  
   - We start with the full array and progressively narrow the unsorted portion.
   - The loop variable `i` marks the start of the unsorted portion.

2. **Find the minimum element in the unsorted range**:  
   - Iterate over the unsorted portion of the array (`j` from `i+1` to `n-1`).
   - Keep track of the index of the minimum element.

3. **Swap the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted range**:  
   - Swap the found minimum element with `arr[i]`.

4. **Repeat until the array is sorted**:  
   - The loop runs `n-1` times because the last element is already sorted by the end.

### **Algorithm (Step-by-Step)**
1. Start with an array `arr` of size `n`.
2. Run an outer loop from `i = 0` to `n-1` (which determines the start of the unsorted portion).
3. Inside the loop:
   - Assume the first element of the unsorted portion (`arr[i]`) is the smallest.
   - Run an inner loop from `j = i+1` to `n-1` to find the minimum element.
   - If `arr[j] < arr[mini]`, update `mini = j`.
4. Swap `arr[i]` with `arr[mini]`.
5. Continue until all elements are sorted.

### **Dry Run Example**
#### **Input Array**:  
`arr[] = {7, 5, 9, 2, 8}`  

#### **Step-by-step Execution:**
1. **Iteration 1 (i = 0, range: 0 to n-1)**
   - Find the minimum element in `{7, 5, 9, 2, 8}` → **2** (index 3)
   - Swap `arr[0]` with `arr[3]` → `{2, 5, 9, 7, 8}`
   
2. **Iteration 2 (i = 1, range: 1 to n-1)**
   - Find the minimum element in `{5, 9, 7, 8}` → **5** (index 1)
   - Swap `arr[1]` with `arr[1]` (no change)

3. **Iteration 3 (i = 2, range: 2 to n-1)**
   - Find the minimum element in `{9, 7, 8}` → **7** (index 3)
   - Swap `arr[2]` with `arr[3]` → `{2, 5, 7, 9, 8}`

4. **Iteration 4 (i = 3, range: 3 to n-1)**
   - Find the minimum element in `{9, 8}` → **8** (index 4)
   - Swap `arr[3]` with `arr[4]` → `{2, 5, 7, 8, 9}`

5. **Iteration 5 (i = 4, range: 4 to n-1)**
   - Only one element left, no further swaps needed.

#### **Final Sorted Array:** `{2, 5, 7, 8, 9}`

### **CODE**
```javascript
let arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 3, 0, -1, -2, 3]

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {

    // find smallest number index
  let smallestIndex = i;    // Assume Current index is minimum 
  for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
    if (arr[j] < arr[smallestIndex]) {
      smallestIndex = j;   // Smallest Number Index Update
    }
    // swaping
    if(smallestIndex !== i){
    let temp = arr[i];
    arr[i] = arr[smallestIndex];
    arr[smallestIndex] = temp;
    }
  }
}

console.log(arr);
```

### **Edge Cases to Consider**
1. **Already Sorted Array**  
   - `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` → Still performs O(n²) comparisons.
2. **Reverse Sorted Array**  
   - `{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}` → Worst case, requires maximum swaps.
3. **All Elements Same**  
   - `{7, 7, 7, 7, 7}` → No swaps needed, but comparisons still occur.
4. **Single Element Array**  
   - `{9}` → No sorting needed, algorithm runs once.
5. **Empty Array**  
   - `[]` → No sorting needed, edge case should be handled.

### **Final Notes on Selection Sort**
1. Selection Sort is a **comparison-based sorting algorithm** that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.
2. It runs in **O(n²) time complexity** in all cases, making it inefficient for large datasets.
3. It is **not stable** and **not adaptive**.
4. It is best used for **small datasets** or **when memory constraints require in-place sorting**.
