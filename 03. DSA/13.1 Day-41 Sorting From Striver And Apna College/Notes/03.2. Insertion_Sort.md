```Javascript
let arr = [13,46,24,52,20,9]

for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
    let j = i

    while(j >= 0 && arr[j-1] > arr[j]){
        let temp = arr[j-1]
        arr[j-1] = arr[j]
        arr[j] = temp

        j--
    }
}

console.log(arr);
```

### **Iteration 1 (`i = 0`)**
**Initial State:**
- `j = i = 0`
- **Current Element:** `5`

Since `j = 0`, there are no previous elements to compare. The inner loop does not run.

**Array after Iteration 1:** `[5, 3, 4, 2, 1]`

---

### **Iteration 2 (`i = 1`)**
**Initial State:**
- `j = i = 1`
- **Current Element:** `3`

**Comparison & Swapping:**
1. Compare `arr[j] = 3` with `arr[j-1] = 5`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `5 > 3`
   - Swap `5` and `3`
   - Array becomes: `[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`
   - Update `j-- → j = 0` (Move `j` left)

**While Loop Check:**
- Now that `j = 0`, we check if we should continue the while loop.
- Since `j = 0`, `arr[j-1]` is out of bounds (`arr[-1]` doesn't exist), and the condition fails, breaking the loop.

**Array after Iteration 2:** `[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`

---

### **Iteration 3 (`i = 2`)**
**Initial State:**
- `j = i = 2`
- **Current Element:** `4`

**Comparison & Swapping:**
1. Compare `arr[j] = 4` with `arr[j-1] = 5`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `5 > 4`
   - Swap `5` and `4`
   - Array becomes: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]`
   - Update `j-- → j = 1` (Move `j` left)

**While Loop Check:**
- Now, `j = 1`, compare `arr[j] = 4` with `arr[j-1] = 3`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `3 < 4`
   - No swap needed, and the inner loop breaks.

**Array after Iteration 3:** `[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]`

---

### **Iteration 4 (`i = 3`)**
**Initial State:**
- `j = i = 3`
- **Current Element:** `2`

**Comparison & Swapping:**
1. Compare `arr[j] = 2` with `arr[j-1] = 5`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `5 > 2`
   - Swap `5` and `2`
   - Array becomes: `[3, 4, 2, 5, 1]`
   - Update `j-- → j = 2` (Move `j` left)

2. Compare `arr[j] = 2` with `arr[j-1] = 4`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `4 > 2`
   - Swap `4` and `2`
   - Array becomes: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 1]`
   - Update `j-- → j = 1` (Move `j` left)

3. Compare `arr[j] = 2` with `arr[j-1] = 3`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `3 > 2`
   - Swap `3` and `2`
   - Array becomes: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
   - Update `j-- → j = 0` (Move `j` left)

**While Loop Check:**
- Now, `j = 0`, so `arr[j-1]` is invalid (`arr[-1]` doesn't exist).
- The loop exits as the condition is not met.

**Array after Iteration 4:** `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`

### **Iteration 5 (`i = 4`)**
**Initial State:**
- `j = i = 4`
- **Current Element:** `1`

**Comparison & Swapping:**
1. Compare `arr[j] = 1` with `arr[j-1] = 5`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `5 > 1`
   - Swap `5` and `1`
   - Array becomes: `[2, 3, 4, 1, 5]`
   - Update `j-- → j = 3` (Move `j` left)

2. Compare `arr[j] = 1` with `arr[j-1] = 4`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `4 > 1`
   - Swap `4` and `1`
   - Array becomes: `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`
   - Update `j-- → j = 2` (Move `j` left)

3. Compare `arr[j] = 1` with `arr[j-1] = 3`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `3 > 1`
   - Swap `3` and `1`
   - Array becomes: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Update `j-- → j = 1` (Move `j` left)

4. Compare `arr[j] = 1` with `arr[j-1] = 2`
   - **Condition:** `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` → `2 > 1`
   - Swap `2` and `1`
   - Array becomes: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Update `j-- → j = 0` (Move `j` left)

**While Loop Check:**
- Now, `j = 0`, so the while condition `arr[j-1]` is invalid because `arr[-1]` doesn't exist.
- The loop breaks.

**Array after Iteration 5:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

### **Final Sorted Array:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

### **Key Insights:**
- **Update of `j--`:** As each element is swapped, `j` is updated to move leftwards, allowing the algorithm to check the previous elements to find the correct position.
- **End of Loop Condition:** Once `j = 0`, the loop exits as it tries to access an invalid index (`arr[-1]`), thus preventing any further comparisons or swaps.

This update highlights the important step where the condition `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` determines whether the algorithm should swap elements.
