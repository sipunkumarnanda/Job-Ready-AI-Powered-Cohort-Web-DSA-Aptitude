# **Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) - Detailed Notes**  

## 📌 **What is Data Structure (DS)?**  
A **Data Structure (DS)** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. It provides a structured format to store, manage, and retrieve data for various computational tasks.  

### 🔹 **Why are Data Structures Important?**  
✅ Helps in organizing and storing data efficiently.  
✅ Enhances performance and reduces time complexity.  
✅ Essential for solving real-world problems in programming.  
✅ Used in databases, operating systems, AI, and many applications.  

### 🔹 **Types of Data Structures**  
Data structures are mainly categorized into two types:  

### 1️⃣ **Linear Data Structures** (Elements arranged sequentially)  
📌 **Array** – Collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.  
📌 **Linked List** – Collection of nodes connected via pointers.  
📌 **Stack** – Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.  
📌 **Queue** – Follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.  

### 2️⃣ **Non-Linear Data Structures** (Elements are not arranged in sequence)  
📌 **Tree** – Hierarchical data structure (e.g., Binary Tree, BST).  
📌 **Graph** – Collection of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections).  
📌 **Heap** – Specialized tree-based data structure (used in priority queues).  
📌 **Hash Table** – Stores key-value pairs for fast data retrieval.

## 📌 **What is an Algorithm?**  
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step process to solve a specific problem. It is like a **recipe** that provides instructions on how to accomplish a task efficiently.  

### 🔹 **Why are Algorithms Important?**  
✅ Helps solve problems systematically and efficiently.  
✅ Improves code performance and optimization.  
✅ Essential for competitive programming and technical interviews.  
✅ Used in AI, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, etc.  

### 🔹 **Characteristics of a Good Algorithm**  
✔ **Correctness** – Produces the correct output for all valid inputs.  
✔ **Efficiency** – Uses minimum time and memory.  
✔ **Finiteness** – It must complete in a finite number of steps.  
✔ **Clarity** – Easy to understand and implement.  
✔ **Generality** – Works for a variety of inputs.

## 📌 **Types of Algorithms**  

### 1️⃣ **Searching Algorithms** – Used to find an element in a data structure.  
🔹 **Linear Search** – Searches each element one by one.  
🔹 **Binary Search** – Uses the divide-and-conquer approach (faster).  

### 2️⃣ **Sorting Algorithms** – Used to arrange data in a specific order.  
🔹 **Bubble Sort** – Compares adjacent elements and swaps them.  
🔹 **Selection Sort** – Selects the smallest element and places it at the beginning.  
🔹 **Quick Sort** – Uses recursion and partitioning.  
🔹 **Merge Sort** – Uses divide-and-conquer for efficient sorting.  

### 3️⃣ **Recursion Algorithms** – A function that calls itself for problem-solving.  
🔹 **Factorial Calculation**  
🔹 **Fibonacci Series**  
🔹 **Tower of Hanoi**  

### 4️⃣ **Graph Algorithms** – Used to process graphs.  
🔹 **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – Finds the shortest path in a graph.  
🔹 **DFS (Depth-First Search)** – Explores as far as possible along a branch.  
🔹 **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** – Explores all neighbors first.
