# **ðŸ“Œ Notes on Arrays and Data Structures**  

## **ðŸ“Œ What is an Array?**  
An **Array** is a **linear data structure** that stores multiple values in **continuous** memory locations. It allows storing multiple elements of the same type under a single variable name.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Key Features of an Array:**  
âœ… Stores multiple values of the same data type.  
âœ… Uses **contiguous memory allocation** (stored next to each other in memory).  
âœ… Accessed using **indexing** (starting from 0).  
âœ… Fixed in size (in most programming languages).  

### **ðŸ”¹ Example of an Array in JavaScript:**  
```javascript
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; // Array of integers
console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 10
```

## **ðŸ“Œ What is a Linear Data Structure?**  
A **Linear Data Structure** is a structure in which elements are arranged **one after another (ek ke baad ek)**. Each element is connected to its **previous and next element** in a logical sequence.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Examples of Linear Data Structures:**  
âœ” **Array** â€“ Collection of elements stored in contiguous memory.  
âœ” **Linked List** â€“ Collection of nodes where each node points to the next.  
âœ” **Stack** â€“ Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.  
âœ” **Queue** â€“ Follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Characteristics of Linear Data Structures:**  
âœ” Elements are arranged **sequentially**.  
âœ” Memory is allocated **contiguously** or dynamically (e.g., linked lists).  
âœ” Traversed using **loops** or **pointers**.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Example of a Linear Data Structure (Array in JavaScript):**  
```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits[1]); // Output: Banana
```

## **ðŸ“Œ What is a Non-Linear Data Structure?**  
A **Non-Linear Data Structure** is a structure where elements are **not arranged sequentially**. Instead, they are stored in a hierarchical or interconnected manner.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Examples of Non-Linear Data Structures:**  
âœ” **Tree** â€“ A hierarchical structure (e.g., Binary Tree, BST).  
âœ” **Graph** â€“ A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.  
âœ” **Heap** â€“ A specialized tree-based data structure.  
âœ” **Hash Table** â€“ Stores key-value pairs for fast access.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Characteristics of Non-Linear Data Structures:**  
âœ” Elements are stored in a **non-sequential** manner.  
âœ” Suitable for **complex relationships** (e.g., social networks, file systems).  
âœ” Uses **graph traversal algorithms** like DFS, BFS.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Example of a Non-Linear Data Structure (Tree in JavaScript):**  
```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

let root = new Node(10);
root.left = new Node(5);
root.right = new Node(20);
console.log(root); // Output: Tree structure
```

## **ðŸ“Œ Difference Between Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures**  

| Feature | Linear Data Structure | Non-Linear Data Structure |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Definition** | Elements are arranged **sequentially** (one after another). | Elements are stored in a **hierarchical or interconnected** manner. |
| **Memory Allocation** | **Contiguous/Dynamic memory** allocation. | **Non-contiguous** memory allocation. |
| **Complexity** | Simpler and easier to implement. | More complex but useful for real-world problems. |
| **Traversal** | Can be traversed **sequentially** (one-by-one). | Traversal requires **special algorithms** (DFS, BFS). |
| **Examples** | Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue. | Tree, Graph, Heap, Hash Table. |

## **ðŸ“Œ Conclusion**  
âœ” **Linear Data Structures** are simple and efficient for ordered data storage.  
âœ” **Non-Linear Data Structures** are useful for complex relationships (e.g., trees and graphs).  
âœ” **Arrays** are the most commonly used **linear data structure** because of their fast access time.  

ðŸš€ **Mastering both types of data structures is essential for solving real-world problems efficiently!**
