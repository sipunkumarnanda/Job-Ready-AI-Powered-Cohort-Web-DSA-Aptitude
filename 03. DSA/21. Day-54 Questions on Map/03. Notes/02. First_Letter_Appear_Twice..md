
### 🧠 **Problem Statement**
**Leetcode 2351 – First Letter to Appear Twice**

> You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. Return the **first** letter that appears **twice**.

**Example:**
```js
Input: s = "abccbaacz"
Output: "c"
```

---

### 🔧 **Logic Used**

1. Create a `Map` to store each character and its frequency.
2. Loop through the string `s`.
3. For every character:
   - If it's already in the map:
     - Increase its frequency by 1.
     - If the frequency becomes `2`, print the character (as it's the first one to repeat).
   - If it's not in the map, set its frequency as 1.
4. Use `break` to exit once the first repeating character is found.

### 🔍 **Step-by-Step Execution**

```js
let s = "habcdefghijawxhy"
let map = new Map()
```

| Iteration | char | map before | map after                  | Output |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| 1         | h    | {}          | { h: 1 }                    |        |
| 2         | a    | { h: 1 }    | { h:1, a:1 }                |        |
| 3         | b    | {...}       | { h:1, a:1, b:1 }           |        |
| ...       | ...  | ...         | ...                         |        |
| 11        | a    | {...}       | { a:2 }                     | `a` printed ✅

### ✅ **Why Map?**
- Map allows **O(1)** access and updating of character counts.
- Clean structure for tracking character frequencies efficiently.

### 💡 **Optimized Version (Early Exit)**
Your code is already optimal with early exit using `break` after the first match.

### 📌 Final Clean Code
```js
let s = "habcdefghijawxhy"
let map = new Map()

for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    let ch = s.charAt(i)
    if(map.has(ch)) {
        map.set(ch, map.get(ch) + 1)
        if(map.get(ch) === 2) {
            console.log(ch)
            break
        }
    } else {
        map.set(ch, 1)
    }
}
```
