
## 🧠 Problem: Two Sum

### 🔹 Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Example:**
```js
Input: nums = [15, 2, 11, 7], target = 9  
Output: [1, 3]  // because nums[1] + nums[3] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

## 🧮 Logic Behind the Code

The naive approach is to use two nested loops and check every pair, which takes **O(n²)** time. But using a **Hash Map**, we can reduce the time complexity to **O(n)**.

### 💡 Key Idea:
- For every element `nums[i]`, check if the **complement** (`target - nums[i]`) exists in the map.
- If it does, return the current index and the index of the complement.
- If not, store the current number and its index in the map.

## 🧾 Code Explanation

```js
let nums = [15, 2, 11, 7];
let target = 9;
let map = new Map();
```
- `nums`: The input array
- `target`: The sum we are trying to achieve
- `map`: A `Map` to store each number as key and its index as value

### 🔄 Loop Breakdown:

```js
for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    let sub = target - nums[i]; // Calculate the complement
    if(map.has(sub)) {
        console.log(map.get(sub), i); // Found the pair
        break;
    } else {
        map.set(nums[i], i); // Store the current number and its index
    }
}
```

- Iteration 1 (`i = 0`, `nums[0] = 15`):
  - `sub = 9 - 15 = -6`
  - `map` does **not** have `-6`, so we store `15` with index `0`: `map = {15 => 0}`

- Iteration 2 (`i = 1`, `nums[1] = 2`):
  - `sub = 9 - 2 = 7`
  - `map` does **not** have `7`, so we store `2` with index `1`: `map = {15 => 0, 2 => 1}`

- Iteration 3 (`i = 2`, `nums[2] = 11`):
  - `sub = 9 - 11 = -2`
  - `map` does **not** have `-2`, so we store `11` with index `2`: `map = {15 => 0, 2 => 1, 11 => 2}`

- Iteration 4 (`i = 3`, `nums[3] = 7`):
  - `sub = 9 - 7 = 2`
  - `map` **has** `2` at index `1`
  - ✅ Found the pair: `2 + 7 = 9` → print indices: `1 3`

## 🧮 Final Output

```
1 3
```

These are the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

## 🔄 Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

1. Initialize an empty `Map`
2. Loop through each element of the array:
   - Calculate the difference between the target and the current element
   - Check if this difference exists in the map
     - If it does, return the pair of indices
     - If it doesn’t, add the current number and its index to the map

## ⏱ Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – because we traverse the array only once
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) – in the worst case, we store all elements in the map
