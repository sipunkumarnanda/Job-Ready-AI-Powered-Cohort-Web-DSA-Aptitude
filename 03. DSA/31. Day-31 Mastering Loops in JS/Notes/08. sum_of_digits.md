# **Logic Behind Finding the Sum of Digits of a Number**  

## **Understanding the Concept**  
When we are given a number, the **sum of its digits** means adding up all the individual digits that make up the number.  

For example, if we take **4321**, its digits are **4, 3, 2, and 1**. The sum of these digits is:  
\[
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
\]  
Our goal is to break the number into its digits and keep adding them until no digits are left.

---

## **Breaking the Number Digit by Digit**  
To extract individual digits from a number, we need to **isolate** the last digit first, add it to the sum, then remove it from the number, and repeat this process until the number becomes **0**.

### **Step-by-Step Logical Breakdown**
1. **Extract the Last Digit**  
   - The last digit of any number can be found using **modulus (`%`) operator** with `10`.  
   - Example:  
     \[
     4321 \mod 10 = 1
     \]
     So, the last digit is **1**.

2. **Add the Extracted Digit to the Sum**  
   - Keep adding the extracted digits to a variable called `sum`.  
   - Example:
     - Initially, `sum = 0`
     - After extracting `1`, update sum:  
       \[
       sum = sum + 1 = 1
       \]

3. **Remove the Last Digit from the Number**  
   - The last digit can be removed by performing **integer division (`/ 10`)**.  
   - Example:
     \[
     4321 \div 10 = 432
     \]
     Now, the number becomes `432`, and we repeat the process.

4. **Repeat Until the Number Becomes 0**  
   - We continue extracting the last digit, adding it to `sum`, and removing it until the number becomes **0**.  
   - Step-by-step breakdown for `4321`:
     ```
     4321 % 10 = 1  â†’ sum = 0 + 1 = 1  â†’ 4321 / 10 = 432
     432 % 10 = 2  â†’ sum = 1 + 2 = 3  â†’ 432 / 10 = 43
     43 % 10 = 3  â†’ sum = 3 + 3 = 6  â†’ 43 / 10 = 4
     4 % 10 = 4  â†’ sum = 6 + 4 = 10  â†’ 4 / 10 = 0
     ```
     Now, the number is **0**, so we stop.

## **Key Takeaways**
- We extract the **last digit** using `% 10`.
- We **add** this digit to `sum`.
- We **remove** the last digit using `/ 10` and repeat.
- The process stops when the number becomes **0**.
- This ensures that all digits are processed and added together.

## **Real-Life Analogy**  
Imagine you have **4321 rupees** in different denominations (**1000s, 100s, 10s, and 1s**). You want to count how much money you have in total by summing up each digit separately. This logic is similar to our approach, where we break down a number into its individual digits and sum them up.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Process**

We are given the number **4321**, and we want to find the sum of its digits by following these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Extract the Last Digit**
We use **modulus (`%`) operator** with `10` to get the last digit.

\[
4321 \mod 10 = 1
\]

- **Extracted Digit:** `1`
- **Add to Sum:** `0 + 1 = 1`
- **Remove Last Digit:** Perform integer division (`/ 10`):

\[
4321 \div 10 = 432
\]

Now, the number **4321** becomes **432**.

---

### **Step 2: Extract the Last Digit of 432**
\[
432 \mod 10 = 2
\]

- **Extracted Digit:** `2`
- **Add to Sum:** `1 + 2 = 3`
- **Remove Last Digit:**
\[
432 \div 10 = 43
\]

Now, the number **432** becomes **43**.

---

### **Step 3: Extract the Last Digit of 43**
\[
43 \mod 10 = 3
\]

- **Extracted Digit:** `3`
- **Add to Sum:** `3 + 3 = 6`
- **Remove Last Digit:**
\[
43 \div 10 = 4
\]

Now, the number **43** becomes **4**.

---

### **Step 4: Extract the Last Digit of 4**
\[
4 \mod 10 = 4
\]

- **Extracted Digit:** `4`
- **Add to Sum:** `6 + 4 = 10`
- **Remove Last Digit:**
\[
4 \div 10 = 0
\]

Now, the number **4** becomes **0**, so we stop.

### **Final Sum**
At the end of this process, the sum of the digits of **4321** is **10**.

## **Summary of Steps in Table Format**

| Step | Number | Extracted Digit (`% 10`) | Sum (`sum + digit`) | Remaining Number (`/ 10`) |
|------|--------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1    | 4321   | 1              | 0 + 1 = 1        | 432            |
| 2    | 432    | 2              | 1 + 2 = 3        | 43             |
| 3    | 43     | 3              | 3 + 3 = 6        | 4              |
| 4    | 4      | 4              | 6 + 4 = 10       | 0 (Stop)       |

### **Key Takeaways**
- We **extract** the last digit using `% 10`.
- We **add** it to the sum.
- We **remove** the last digit using `/ 10`.
- We repeat this process **until the number becomes 0**.

This ensures that all digits are processed and summed correctly. ðŸš€

### **Problem Statement:**  
We need to find the sum of all the digits of a given number.  

### **Example:**  
If the user inputs **4321**, then the sum of its digits is:  
**4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10**  

---

### **Code Implementation:**
```javascript
// Q2. Print sum of a given number 
let n = Number(prompt("Enter a number : "));   // Example: 4321
let res = n;  // Store the original number in a separate variable
let sum = 0;  // Initialize sum to 0

while (res > 0) {  // Loop continues until res becomes 0
    let rem = res % 10;  // Extract the last digit
    sum = sum + rem;  // Add the last digit to sum
    res = Math.floor(res / 10);  // Remove the last digit
}

console.log(`Sum of digits of ${n} is: ${sum}`);
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**  

1. **Taking Input:**  
   - The program takes an input number from the user.  
   - Example input: **4321**  

2. **Loop Execution:**  
   - The `while` loop runs as long as the number is greater than `0`.  

3. **Extracting the Last Digit:**  
   - We use the modulo operator (`% 10`) to get the last digit of the number.  
   - Example: `4321 % 10 = 1` (last digit is 1).  

4. **Adding the Last Digit to Sum:**  
   - We add the extracted last digit to the variable `sum`.  
   - Example: `sum = sum + 1`.  

5. **Removing the Last Digit:**  
   - We remove the last digit using integer division (`Math.floor(number / 10)`).  
   - Example: `Math.floor(4321 / 10) = 432` (removes the last digit).  

6. **Repeat Until the Number Becomes 0:**  
   - The loop continues until the number becomes `0`, and all digits are added.

### **Dry Run (Step-by-Step Execution for Input: 4321):**  

| Iteration | `res` Value | `rem` (Last Digit) | `sum` (Updated) | `res` After Removing Last Digit |
|-----------|------------|--------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 1st       | 4321       | 1                  | 0 + 1 = 1      | 432                           |
| 2nd       | 432        | 2                  | 1 + 2 = 3      | 43                            |
| 3rd       | 43         | 3                  | 3 + 3 = 6      | 4                             |
| 4th       | 4          | 4                  | 6 + 4 = 10     | 0 (Loop stops)                |

**Final Output:**  
`Sum of digits of 4321 is: 10`
