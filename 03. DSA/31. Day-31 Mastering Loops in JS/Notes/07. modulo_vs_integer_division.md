# Modulo (%) gives the remainder when dividing two numbers.
# If the dividend (numerator) is smaller than the divisor (denominator), the remainder is always the dividend itself.
# Integer division (Math.floor(a / b)) returns 0 if a < b, because a is not large enough to be divided at least once.

# **Understanding Modulo and Integer Division in JavaScript**  

## **Concept 1: Modulo Operation (`%`)**  
The **modulo operator (`%`)** returns the remainder when one number is divided by another.  

### **Example:**
```javascript
console.log(2 % 10); // Output: 2 (Remainder when 2 is divided by 10)
```
### **Explanation:**
- When **2** is divided by **10**, the quotient is **0** (since 10 cannot fully divide 2).
- The remainder left is **2**, which is the output of `2 % 10`.

## **Concept 2: Integer Division Using `Math.floor()`**  
The **`Math.floor()`** function rounds a number **down** to the nearest integer.

### **Example:**
```javascript
console.log(Math.floor(2 / 10)); // Output: 0 (Integer division result)
```
### **Explanation:**
- When **2** is divided by **10**, the result is **0.2**.
- Since **integer division** requires discarding the decimal part, `Math.floor(2 / 10)` rounds **0.2** down to **0**.

## **Key Takeaways:**
1. **Modulo (`%`)** gives the remainder when dividing two numbers.
2. If the **dividend** (numerator) is **smaller** than the **divisor** (denominator), the **remainder is always the dividend itself**.
3. **Integer division (`Math.floor(a / b)`)** returns **0** if `a < b`, because `a` is not large enough to be divided at least once.

## **Real-Life Example:**
- Imagine you have **2 chocolates** and want to distribute them among **10** people.
  - Using **`2 % 10`**, the remainder is **2** (chocolates left after distributing as much as possible).
  - Using **`Math.floor(2 / 10)`**, the result is **0**, meaning each person gets **0 chocolates**.
