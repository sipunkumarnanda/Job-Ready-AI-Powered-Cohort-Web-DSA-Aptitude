# **Notes on While Loop in JavaScript**  

## **Introduction to While Loop**  
A **while loop** is an **entry-controlled loop** in JavaScript. It is used when we do not know in advance how many times the loop should run, but we want to continue executing a block of code as long as a certain condition remains **true**.  

### **Syntax of While Loop**  
```js
while(condition){
   // Code to be executed
}
```
- **condition**: The loop continues to execute as long as this condition remains **true**.  
- If the **condition** is false from the beginning, the loop **will not execute even once**.  

---

## **How While Loop Works?**  
1. **Check Condition** ‚Üí If the condition evaluates to `true`, the loop executes.  
2. **Execute Code Block** ‚Üí The statements inside the loop body run.  
3. **Update Condition** ‚Üí The loop control variable should be updated inside the loop to avoid an infinite loop.  
4. **Repeat or Exit** ‚Üí The condition is checked again, and if still `true`, the loop continues; otherwise, it stops.

## **Example 1: Print "Hello World" 10 Times Using While Loop**  
```js
let i = 1;   // Initialization
let n = 10;  // Number of times to print

while (i <= n) {  // Condition
    console.log("Hello World");
    i++; // Increment to prevent infinite loop
}
```
### **Output:**  
```
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
```
‚úÖ **Explanation:**  
- The loop starts with `i = 1`.  
- It prints `"Hello World"` as long as `i <= 10`.  
- After each iteration, `i` increases by `1` (`i++`).  
- Once `i = 11`, the condition becomes false, and the loop stops.

## **Example 2: Sum of Natural Numbers Using While Loop**  
### **Problem Statement:**  
Find the sum of all numbers from `1` to `n` using a while loop.  

```js
let i = 1, n = 10, sum = 0;

while (i <= n) {
    sum += i;  // Adding the current value of i to sum
    i++;       // Incrementing i
}

console.log(`Sum of 1 to ${n} is ${sum}`);
```
### **Output:**  
```
Sum of 1 to 10 is 55
```
‚úÖ **Explanation:**  
- **Initialization**: `i = 1`, `sum = 0`.  
- **Loop Condition**: `while (i <= 10)`.  
- **Inside Loop**: Add `i` to `sum`, then increment `i`.  
- **Loop continues** until `i` becomes `11`, then it stops.  

üìå **Mathematical Formula for Sum:**  
Instead of using a loop, we can calculate the sum using the formula:  
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
‚úÖ **Optimized version using formula:**  
```js
let n = 10;
console.log(`Sum of 1 to ${n} is ${(n * (n + 1)) / 2}`);
```

## **Use Cases of While Loop in Real Life**
1. **User Authentication System**  
   - Keep asking for a correct password until the user enters the right one.  
   ```js
   let password;
   while (password !== "1234") {
       password = prompt("Enter your password:");
   }
   console.log("Access Granted!");
   ```
  
2. **ATM Machine Withdrawal**  
   - Keep asking for a valid withdrawal amount until the user enters a correct value.  

3. **Game Development**  
   - While the player's health is greater than zero, the game continues.  

4. **Server Monitoring**  
   - A loop continuously checks the status of a server and restarts it if needed.  

---

## **Important Notes About While Loop**
1. **Ensure that the loop condition eventually becomes false** to avoid an **infinite loop**.  
   ```js
   let i = 1;
   while (i > 0) {  // Infinite loop! No stopping condition
       console.log("This will run forever!");
   }
   ```
   üî¥ **Fix:** Always update the loop variable inside the loop.  

2. **When to Use While Loop?**
   - When the number of iterations is **unknown** beforehand.  
   - When we need to **repeat** an operation until a condition is met.

## **Conclusion**
‚úÖ The **while loop** is a powerful looping statement in JavaScript that keeps executing a block of code as long as a condition is **true**.  
‚úÖ It is widely used in **user authentication**, **data processing**, **real-time monitoring**, and **game development**.  
‚úÖ Always ensure that the condition eventually becomes **false** to prevent infinite loops.

## **Real-Life Use Cases of While Loop and For Loop** üöÄ  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ For Loop ‚Äì When We Know the Number of Iterations**  
üìå **Used when we have a fixed number of repetitions.**  

#### **üîπ Real-Life Examples:**  
1. **Counting Days of the Week** ‚Äì A week always has **7 days**, so we loop exactly **7 times**.  
2. **Taking Attendance in a Classroom** ‚Äì If there are **50 students**, we iterate exactly **50 times**.  
3. **Running a Timer** ‚Äì A stopwatch counting down from **10 seconds to 0**.  
4. **Printing a Shopping List** ‚Äì You know there are **10 items**, so loop **10 times**.  

#### **üíª Example: Printing the Days of a Week**
```js
let days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"];

for (let i = 0; i < days.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Day ${i + 1}: ${days[i]}`);
}
```
‚úÖ **Why For Loop?**  
- We **know** the exact number of days (**7 times**).

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ While Loop ‚Äì When We Don‚Äôt Know the Number of Iterations**  
üìå **Used when the loop continues until a condition is met (unknown repetitions).**  

#### **üîπ Real-Life Examples:**  
1. **Waiting in a Queue** ‚Äì You wait in a line until your turn comes.  
2. **Downloading a File** ‚Äì The process runs **until** the file is fully downloaded.  
3. **ATM Cash Withdrawal** ‚Äì You withdraw money **until** your balance reaches zero.  
4. **Game Over Condition** ‚Äì A game runs **until** the player loses all lives.  

#### **üíª Example: Withdrawing Money Until Balance is Zero**
```js
let balance = 5000;  

while (balance > 0) {
    let withdrawal = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 500; // Random withdrawal (‚Çπ500 - ‚Çπ1500)

    if (balance >= withdrawal) {
        console.log(`Withdrew ‚Çπ${withdrawal}. Remaining balance: ‚Çπ${balance - withdrawal}`);
        balance -= withdrawal;
    } else {
        console.log(`Not enough balance to withdraw ‚Çπ${withdrawal}.`);
        break;
    }
}
console.log("Bank balance is empty. Transaction stopped.");
```
‚úÖ **Why While Loop?**  
- We **don‚Äôt know** how many withdrawals will happen before the balance reaches **‚Çπ0**.

## **üìù Summary ‚Äì When to Use Which Loop?**
| **Loop Type** | **Best Used When** | **Real-Life Example** |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **For Loop** | Fixed number of iterations | Taking attendance, counting steps, printing a list |
| **While Loop** | Runs until a condition is met | Waiting in a queue, withdrawing money, game over condition |
