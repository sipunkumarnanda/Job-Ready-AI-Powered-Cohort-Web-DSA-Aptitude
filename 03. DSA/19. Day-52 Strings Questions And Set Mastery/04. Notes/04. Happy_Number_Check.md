
# 😊 Happy Number Logic in JavaScript

## 🚀 What Is a Happy Number?

A **Happy Number** is a number that eventually becomes `1` when you repeatedly **replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits**.

If it **loops forever** and never becomes 1, it is **not a Happy Number**.

---

## 📘 Example

Let’s take `n = 19`:

```
1² + 9² = 1 + 81 = 82  
8² + 2² = 64 + 4 = 68  
6² + 8² = 36 + 64 = 100  
1² + 0² + 0² = 1
✅ It's a Happy Number!
```

## 💻 Full Code with Comments

```js
let n = 19;
let seen = new Set();  // to keep track of numbers we've seen before

while (n !== 1 && !seen.has(n)) {
    seen.add(n);  // mark this number as seen

    // Step 1: Split digits and square them
    let digits = n.toString().split('');
    let sumOfSquares = 0;

    for (let digit of digits) {
        sumOfSquares += Number(digit) ** 2;
    }

    // Step 2: Update n with the new number
    n = sumOfSquares;
    console.log(n);
}

n === 1 ? console.log("🎉 Happy Number!") : console.log("😢 Not a Happy Number");
```

## 🧠 Purpose of `seen` in Happy Number Problem

```js
let seen = new Set();
```

We use this **Set** to **remember numbers we’ve already seen** during the process of calculating digit squares.  

### ❓ Why?

In a **Happy Number**, if it’s not going to reach `1`, it will start to **repeat the same numbers in a loop**.

To detect that loop, we store each number we calculate.  
- If we **see the same number again**, that means we’re in an **infinite cycle** → not a Happy Number.
- If we reach `1`, then it's a Happy Number.

## 🔁 How `seen` Works Step-by-Step:

### Suppose:
```js
n = 19
```

### First iteration:
- `n = 19`
- Not in `seen`, so: `seen.add(19)`
- Next `n` becomes 82

### Second iteration:
- `n = 82`
- Not in `seen`, so: `seen.add(82)`
- Next `n` becomes 68

...

### Eventually:
If `n` becomes a value already in `seen`, like:
```js
seen.has(n) === true
```

Then you **break the loop** because it's repeating.

---

## ✅ Visual Example:

```js
let seen = new Set(); // start with an empty set

// assume n becomes: 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → ...
```

Before looping:

```js
seen = {4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20}
```

Then `n = 4` again ➜ already in `seen`  
🔁 You’re stuck in a loop!

## 🔐 Final Role of `seen`

| What It Does             | Why It's Important                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Stores visited numbers   | To detect cycles / infinite loops      |
| Prevents infinite loops  | Stops when a repeat is found           |
| Helps decide happy/not   | If 1 is reached → Happy, else → Not    |
