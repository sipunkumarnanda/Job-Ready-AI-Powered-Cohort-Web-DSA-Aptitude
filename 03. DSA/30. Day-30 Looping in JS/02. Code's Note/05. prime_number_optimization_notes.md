# **🔹 Understanding Divisibility and Prime Number Checking Efficiently**
In this detailed note, we will cover two important mathematical properties related to **divisibility and prime number checking**. These properties help us optimize number checks and improve efficiency, especially for prime number determination.

## **📌 Property 1: "If a number is not divisible by 2, then it is not divisible by any other even number."**

### **👉 What Does This Mean?**
- Any **even number** is **always divisible by 2**.
- If a number **is not divisible by 2**, it means the number is **odd**.
- Since all **even numbers are multiples of 2**, an **odd number can never be divisible by any even number**.

---

### **📌 Why Is This True?**
Let's take an **odd number**, for example, **15**.

1. **Check divisibility by 2:**  
   - `15 ÷ 2 = 7.5` (not a whole number)  
   - `15` is **not divisible** by `2`.  
2. **Check divisibility by other even numbers (4, 6, 8, 10, ...)**  
   - `15 ÷ 4 = 3.75` (not a whole number)  
   - `15 ÷ 6 = 2.5` (not a whole number)  
   - `15 ÷ 8 = 1.875` (not a whole number)  
   - **Conclusion:** Since `15` is **not divisible by 2**, it is also **not divisible by any other even number**.

### **📌 General Rule**
If a number **cannot be divided by 2**, then it **cannot be divided by any number that is a multiple of 2** (such as `4, 6, 8, 10, ...`).

✅ **Example Odd Numbers:**
| Number | Divisible by 2? | Divisible by other even numbers? |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **15**  | ❌ No          | ❌ No (Not divisible by 4, 6, 8, etc.) |
| **27**  | ❌ No          | ❌ No (Not divisible by 4, 6, 8, etc.) |
| **99**  | ❌ No          | ❌ No (Not divisible by 4, 6, 8, etc.) |

🚀 **Shortcut Conclusion:**  
- If a number is **not divisible by 2**, it is **not divisible by any even number**.  
- If a number **is divisible by any even number**, it **must also be divisible by 2**.

## **📌 Property 2: "If a number is not divisible by any number up to its square root, then it cannot be divisible by any number greater than its square root."**

### **👉 What Does This Mean?**
- If a number **is prime**, it means it **cannot be divided by any other number except 1 and itself**.
- Instead of checking **all numbers up to `n`**, we **only need to check up to √n (square root of n)**.
- If a number **is not divisible by any number up to √n**, then it **cannot be divisible by any number greater than √n**.

---

### **📌 Why Check Only Up to √n?**
Factors always occur in **pairs**.  
If `n = A × B`, then either **A or B must be ≤ √n**.

✅ **Example:**  
Let's take **n = 36** and find its factors:

| Factor Pair | Smallest Factor |
|-------------|----------------|
| `1 × 36`   | `1` ✅ |
| `2 × 18`   | `2` ✅ |
| `3 × 12`   | `3` ✅ |
| `4 × 9`    | `4` ✅ |
| `6 × 6`    | `6` ✅ |

Notice that **after 6, the factors start repeating in reverse**.  
- Since **√36 = 6**, we only need to check **up to 6**.  
- If a number **has no factors up to √n**, it means **it has no factors at all**, making it **prime**.

---

### **📌 Why Is This True?**
1. If `n` is **composite** (not prime), it can be written as the product of **two smaller numbers**, say **`A × B = n`**.
2. If **both `A` and `B` were greater than `√n`**, then their **product would be greater than `n`**, which is **not possible**.
3. Therefore, **at least one factor must be less than or equal to `√n`**.

✅ **Example:**
For **n = 100**, let's list its factors:

| Factor Pair | Smallest Factor |
|-------------|----------------|
| `1 × 100`   | `1` ✅ |
| `2 × 50`    | `2` ✅ |
| `4 × 25`    | `4` ✅ |
| `5 × 20`    | `5` ✅ |
| `10 × 10`   | `10` ✅ |

- The largest factor (`100`) has a **pair (`1`) that is less than `√100 = 10`**.
- This proves that **if a number had a factor, at least one of its factors would be ≤√n**.

---

### **📌 How Does This Save Time?**
- Normally, to check if a number is prime, we would **check divisibility from 2 to n**.
- But with this rule, we **only check from 2 to √n**, which is **much faster**.

✅ **Example:**
| Number `n` | Checking Up To `n` | Checking Only Up To `√n` |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 100        | Check from `2` to `100` (❌ Slow) | Check from `2` to `10` (✅ Faster) |
| 500        | Check from `2` to `500` (❌ Slow) | Check from `2` to `22` (✅ Faster) |
| 10,000     | Check from `2` to `10,000` (❌ Slow) | Check from `2` to `100` (✅ Faster) |

## **📌 Final Takeaway**
| Property | Explanation | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **1. If a number is not divisible by 2, it is not divisible by any even number.** | Since all even numbers are multiples of 2, an odd number cannot be divisible by them. | `15` is odd → Not divisible by `2`, `4`, `6`, `8`, etc. |
| **2. If a number is not divisible by any number up to its square root, it cannot be divisible by any number greater than its square root.** | Any factor pair of a number must have at least one factor ≤√n. | To check if `37` is prime, check only numbers up to `√37 ≈ 6`. |
| **3. Factors occur in pairs, and after √n, they start repeating in reverse order.** | If n = A × B, then either A or B must be ≤ √n. | For 36, pairs are `(1,36), (2,18), (3,12), (4,9), (6,6)`. After 6, factors repeat in reverse. |

## **🎯 Summary**
1. **Odd numbers are never divisible by even numbers (except 2).**  
2. **To check if a number is prime, check divisibility only up to its square root.**  
3. **If a number has no factors up to √n, then it has no factors at all.**  
4. **Factors always occur in pairs, and after √n, they repeat in reverse.**  
5. **This makes prime number checking much faster and efficient!** 🚀
