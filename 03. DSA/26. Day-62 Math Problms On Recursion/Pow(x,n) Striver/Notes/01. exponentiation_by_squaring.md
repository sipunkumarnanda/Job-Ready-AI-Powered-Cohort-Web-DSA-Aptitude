Here’s the **algorithm** for **Exponentiation by Squaring**, written step-by-step in a simple and structured way:

### ✅ Algorithm: Exponentiation by Squaring

**Input**:  
- `x`: the base (a number — can be integer or float)  
- `n`: the exponent (an integer — can be positive, negative, or zero)

**Output**:  
- `x^n`: the result of raising `x` to the power `n`

---

### 📝 Steps:

1. **Handle base case**:  
   If `n == 0`, return `1` (any number to the power 0 is 1)

2. **Make a copy of `n`** to check later if it was negative  
   Let `m = n`

3. **If `n` is negative**:
   - Convert `n` to positive: `n = -n`

4. **Initialize result**:
   - `ans = 1`

5. **Repeat while `n > 0`**:
   - If `n` is even:
     - Set `x = x * x`
     - Set `n = floor(n / 2)`
   - Else (i.e., if `n` is odd):
     - Set `ans = ans * x`
     - Set `n = n - 1`

6. **If original `n` was negative (`m < 0`)**:
   - Set `ans = 1 / ans`

7. **Return `ans`**

### 💡 Example:
To compute `pow(2, 10)`:

```
x = 2, n = 10
Loop:
10 even → x = 4, n = 5
5 odd → ans = 4, n = 4
4 even → x = 16, n = 2
2 even → x = 256, n = 1
1 odd → ans = 4 * 256 = 1024, n = 0
Return ans = 1024
```
