
### ✅ **Topic**: Count of Prime Numbers from 1 to 100 (Optimized)

---

### 📌 **Purpose**
Efficiently **count and print** the total number of prime numbers from **1 to 100** using a loop-based approach with optimizations.

---

### 📄 **Code**
```js
let count = 1; // 2 is the only even prime, so we start with 1

for (let i = 3; i <= 100; i += 2) {
    let isPrime = true;

    for (let j = 3; j <= Math.sqrt(i); j += 2) {
        if (i % j === 0) {
            isPrime = false;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (isPrime) {
        count++;
        console.log(i); // Print each prime number
    }
}

console.log(count); // Final prime count from 1 to 100
```

## 🧠 **Step-by-Step Explanation**

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Initialize Prime Counter
```js
let count = 1;
```
- We already know that `2` is a prime number (and it's the only even one).
- So we **start `count` at 1**, and skip even numbers in our loop.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Loop through all **odd numbers** from 3 to 100
```js
for (let i = 3; i <= 100; i += 2)
```
- No need to check even numbers — none of them (except 2) are prime.
- So we **increment by 2** to only test **odd numbers**.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Check if `i` is prime
```js
let isPrime = true;
```
- Assume the current number `i` is prime.

---

### 🔸 Optimization:
```js
for (let j = 3; j <= Math.sqrt(i); j += 2)
```
- We check if `i` is divisible by any odd number `j` from `3` up to `√i`.
- **Why `Math.sqrt(i)`?**  
  If a number has a factor larger than its square root, the smaller factor would have already found it. So we don’t need to check beyond that.

---

### 🔸 If divisible, mark as not prime:
```js
if (i % j === 0) {
    isPrime = false;
    break;
}
```
- If `i` is divisible by `j`, then it's **not a prime**, so we stop checking further.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: If Prime → Increment Count
```js
if (isPrime) {
    count++;
    console.log(i); // Print the prime
}
```
- If after all checks `isPrime` is still true, it's a prime.
- So we increment `count` and print the number.

---

### 🔚 Final Output
```js
console.log(count);
```
- Displays the **total number of prime numbers** from 1 to 100.

---

### 🧪 Output:
```
3
5
7
...
97
Total count: 25
```

✅ Correct! There are **25 prime numbers** between 1 and 100.

---

### 💡 Optimizations Used:
- Skip even numbers (except 2).
- Loop only up to `Math.sqrt(i)` for checking prime.
- Use `j += 2` to check only odd divisors.

---

### ⏱️ Time Complexity:
- For each number `i`, we run an inner loop up to `√i` ⇒ **O(n√n)**
