
### ✅ Function:
```js
function hello(n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;

    let ans = hello(Math.floor(n / 2));
    console.log("ans ", ans);
    return (ans * ans) + 2;
}

let a = hello(5);
console.log(a);
```

## 🔍 Full Step-by-Step with Execution Flow and WAIT Points

---

### ⬇️ Step 1: `hello(5)` is called

- `n = 5`, not `0`, so skip `return 1`
- Go to:
  ```js
  let ans = hello(Math.floor(5 / 2)); // hello(2)
  ```
  🛑 **PAUSE HERE. Nothing below runs yet!**

---

### ⬇️ Step 2: `hello(2)` is called

- `n = 2`, not `0`
- Go to:
  ```js
  let ans = hello(Math.floor(2 / 2)); // hello(1)
  ```
  🛑 **PAUSE. Below code waits.**

---

### ⬇️ Step 3: `hello(1)` is called

- `n = 1`, not `0`
- Go to:
  ```js
  let ans = hello(Math.floor(1 / 2)); // hello(0)
  ```
  🛑 **PAUSE. Still waiting.**

---

### ⬇️ Step 4: `hello(0)` is called

- ✅ Base case reached!
- `return 1` immediately.
- ✅ This is the **first completed call**.

### 🔼 Back to: `hello(1)`

```js
let ans = hello(0); // 1 returned
```

- Now `ans = 1`
- Resume code:
  ```js
  console.log("ans", 1);         // 👉 Prints: ans 1
  return (1 * 1) + 2 = 3;        // returns 3
  ```

---

### 🔼 Back to: `hello(2)`

```js
let ans = hello(1); // 3 returned
```

- Now `ans = 3`
- Resume code:
  ```js
  console.log("ans", 3);         // 👉 Prints: ans 3
  return (3 * 3) + 2 = 11;       // returns 11
  ```

---

### 🔼 Back to: `hello(5)`

```js
let ans = hello(2); // 11 returned
```

- Now `ans = 11`
- Resume code:
  ```js
  console.log("ans", 11);        // 👉 Prints: ans 11
  return (11 * 11) + 2 = 123;    // returns 123
  ```

---

### 🔚 Final Result:

```js
let a = hello(5); // a = 123
console.log(a);   // 👉 Prints: 123
```

---

## ✅ Output Recap:

```
ans 1
ans 3
ans 11
123
```

---

## 🧠 Summary:

Each recursive call:
1. **Waits** at `let ans = hello(...)` — everything below it **does NOT run** yet.
2. **Returns a result**, which is then stored in `ans`.
3. Resumes from where it left off and computes `ans * ans + 2`.
