---

### ðŸ”‘ **Purpose**

In the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**, we start with a prime number `i` (let's say `i = 4`), and the task is to mark **all multiples of `i` as non-prime** (i.e., set them to `false` in the `isPrime` array).

However, we **don't need to mark numbers smaller than `i * i`**, because they would have already been marked by smaller prime numbers. The loop you're asking about effectively **marks the multiples of `i` as non-prime** starting from `i * i`.

### ðŸ“„ **Code Explanation**

```js
let i = 4, n = 30;
for (let j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
    console.log(j);
}
```

#### 1. **Initial Values**:
- `i = 4` (current number we are processing)
- `n = 30` (upper limit of numbers we want to check)

#### 2. **The Loop**:
```js
for (let j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
```

- **Starting Point**: `j = i * i` (i.e., `4 * 4 = 16`).
    - This is the key to the algorithm. We start from `i * i` because all smaller multiples (like `4 * 1`, `4 * 2`, etc.) would have already been marked by smaller primes.
    - For `i = 4`, we start marking multiples from `16`.

- **End Condition**: `j <= n` ensures that we only mark multiples within the range (up to 30 in this case).

- **Increment Step**: `j += i` means that we are incrementing `j` by `i` (i.e., going to the next multiple of `4`).
    - The values of `j` will be `16, 20, 24, 28`.

#### 3. **Inside the Loop**:
```js
console.log(j);
```

- Prints the multiples of `i` (i.e., `4, 8, 12, ...`) within the given range up to `n`.
- In this case, `16, 20, 24, 28` are printed because they are the multiples of `4` starting from `16` and less than or equal to `30`.

### ðŸ”‘ **Why Start at `i * i`?**

- **Efficiency**: We only need to start marking multiples of `i` from `i * i`, because all smaller multiples of `i` (i.e., `i * 1, i * 2, ..., i * (i-1)`) would have already been marked as **non-prime** by smaller prime numbers.
  
    For example:
    - When `i = 4`, numbers like `4 * 1 = 4`, `4 * 2 = 8`, `4 * 3 = 12` would already have been marked by earlier primes like `2`.

---

### ðŸ”„ **Summary of the Steps in the Loop**:
- The loop marks the multiples of `i` (starting from `i * i`) as non-prime in the sieve.
- This approach prevents unnecessary checks and makes the sieve more efficient by starting from `i * i` and skipping numbers already marked by smaller primes.
