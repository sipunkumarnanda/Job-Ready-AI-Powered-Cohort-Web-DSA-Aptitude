### 📌 **Objective**:
You are given a number `x` and an integer `n`. Your task is to compute \( x^n \) (i.e., x raised to the power of n). In this solution, we use a **simple loop (iterative method)** to achieve that.

---

### 🧠 **Concept Recap: Power of a Number**
The power of a number `x^n` means multiplying `x` by itself `n` times:

- Example:  
  \( 2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \)  
  \( 5^4 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625 \)

---

### 🔍 **Code**:
```js
let x = 2 , n = 10;

let res = 1;
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    res = res * x;
}
console.log(res); // Output: 1024
```

---

### 🪜 **Step-by-Step Execution** (For x = 2, n = 10):

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x = 2` (base)
   - `n = 10` (exponent)
   - `res = 1` (stores the result)

2. **Loop Execution**:
   The loop runs `n` times and multiplies `res` by `x` in each iteration.

   - **Iteration 1**: `res = 1 * 2 = 2`
   - **Iteration 2**: `res = 2 * 2 = 4`
   - **Iteration 3**: `res = 4 * 2 = 8`
   - **Iteration 4**: `res = 8 * 2 = 16`
   - **Iteration 5**: `res = 16 * 2 = 32`
   - **Iteration 6**: `res = 32 * 2 = 64`
   - **Iteration 7**: `res = 64 * 2 = 128`
   - **Iteration 8**: `res = 128 * 2 = 256`
   - **Iteration 9**: `res = 256 * 2 = 512`
   - **Iteration 10**: `res = 512 * 2 = 1024`

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `res` is `1024`, which is \( 2^{10} \).

### 🧮 **Time and Space Complexity**:

| Type            | Complexity     |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Time Complexity | **O(n)** — the loop runs `n` times. |
| Space Complexity| **O(1)** — only a few variables are used (no extra space). |

---

### ⚠️ **Limitations** of This Approach:

1. **Inefficient for large `n`**:
   - For very large `n`, the time complexity becomes a bottleneck.  
   - Example: For `x = 2`, `n = 1e9` → This loop would run a **billion times**.

2. **Doesn’t handle negative exponents**:
   - For `n < 0`, it won’t work correctly unless we manually invert the result:
     > \( x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n} \)

---

### ✅ **Improvement Possibilities**:

- Use **Exponentiation by Squaring** (more efficient — `O(log n)`).
- Handle **negative exponents**.
