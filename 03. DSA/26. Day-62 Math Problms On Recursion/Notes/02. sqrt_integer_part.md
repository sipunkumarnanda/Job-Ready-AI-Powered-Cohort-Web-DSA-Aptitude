### **Objective**:
The goal of the problem is to implement a function `sqrt(n)` that returns the **integer part of the square root** of a non-negative integer `n`. The result should be the largest integer `i` such that \( i^2 \leq n \).

For example:
- Input: `49`
- Output: `7` (since \( 7^2 = 49 \), and it's the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to 49)

### **Code Explanation**

```js
function sqrt(n) {
    let i = 1;
    for( ; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (i * i == 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return i - 1;
}

console.log(sqrt(49));  // Output: 7
```

#### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**:

1. **Function Definition**:
   The function `sqrt(n)` aims to find the largest integer `i` such that \( i^2 \leq n \). We will do this using a loop.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - A variable `i` is initialized to `1`, which will start the process of testing for the square roots.
   - The loop runs as long as \( i^2 \leq n \), meaning it will keep checking the value of `i` until it exceeds the value for which \( i^2 \) is greater than `n`.

3. **Loop Execution**:

   The loop works as follows:
   
   - **First Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
     - `i * i = 1 * 1 = 1`, and since `1 <= 49`, the loop continues.
   
   - **Second Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
     - `i * i = 2 * 2 = 4`, and since `4 <= 49`, the loop continues.
   
   - **Third Iteration (`i = 3`)**:
     - `i * i = 3 * 3 = 9`, and since `9 <= 49`, the loop continues.
   
   - **Subsequent Iterations (`i = 4, 5, 6, ...`)**:
     - Similarly, for `i = 4`, `i * i = 16`; for `i = 5`, `i * i = 25`; for `i = 6`, `i * i = 36`; for `i = 7`, `i * i = 49`. In each case, `i * i <= 49`, so the loop continues until `i` exceeds the point where \( i^2 \) is greater than `n`.

   - **Iteration `i = 8`**:
     - `i * i = 8 * 8 = 64`, and since `64 > 49`, the loop exits.

4. **After the Loop Ends**:
   The loop exits when `i = 8`, and at this point `i * i = 64`, which is greater than `n` (49). The correct integer square root of `49` is `7`, as \( 7^2 = 49 \).

5. **Returning the Result**:
   Since `i` has been incremented to `8` (which is too large), the function returns `i - 1`. This is done to adjust the value of `i` back to the correct integer part of the square root of `n`.

   - The value of `i - 1` in this case is `7`, which is the correct integer part of the square root of `49`.

6. **Final Output**:
   The function returns `7`, which is the integer square root of `49`.

### **Issues in the Code**:

- **Unnecessary Condition**: 
  The `if (i * i == 0)` condition inside the loop does not serve any practical purpose, as it is unlikely to ever be true. The loop would stop when \( i^2 \) becomes greater than `n`, not when it is zero.

  - This condition could be removed without changing the behavior of the code.
  - Also, the `if (i * i == 0)` is never true, because the value of `i` is always greater than `0` and the square of any positive integer will never be `0`.

---

### **Optimized Approach**:

The loop could be optimized, removing the unnecessary check `if (i * i == 0)`, as follows:

```js
function sqrt(n) {
    let i = 1;
    for (; i * i <= n; i++) {}
    return i - 1;
}
```

### **Time Complexity**:
- The loop runs until \( i^2 > n \), so the number of iterations is proportional to the square root of `n`.
- **Time Complexity**: O(âˆšn)

### **Space Complexity**:
- The function only uses a constant amount of extra space (i.e., variables like `i` and `n`), so the **space complexity** is O(1).

---

### **Summary**:

- The algorithm uses a simple loop to find the integer part of the square root by checking successive values of `i` and stopping when \( i^2 \) exceeds `n`.
- After the loop ends, `i - 1` is returned as the integer square root.
- The extra condition `if (i * i == 0)` is unnecessary and can be safely removed.
