# **Fall Through in Switch Case in JavaScript**  

## **What is Fall Through in Switch Case?**  
In JavaScript, **fall through** occurs in a `switch` statement when a `case` does not have a `break` statement. Instead of stopping execution after matching a case, the program **continues executing** the next case(s) until it encounters a `break` or the switch block ends.

## **Example of Fall Through**  
```js
let day = 2;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Monday");
    case 2:
        console.log("Tuesday");
    case 3:
        console.log("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        console.log("Thursday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Invalid day");
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Tuesday
Wednesday
```
### **Explanation:**  
- `day = 2` matches with `case 2`, so **"Tuesday"** is printed.  
- Since `case 2` has **no break**, execution **falls through** to `case 3`, printing **"Wednesday"** as well.  
- `case 3` has a `break`, so execution stops there.

## **How to Prevent Fall Through?**  
To **prevent fall through**, always use `break` at the end of each case unless you intentionally want to continue execution.  

### **Corrected Version:**
```js
let day = 2;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        console.log("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        console.log("Thursday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Invalid day");
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Tuesday
```
Now, the program correctly stops execution after printing **"Tuesday"**.

## **When is Fall Through Useful?**
Fall through can be **intentionally used** when multiple cases should execute the same logic.  

### **Example: Grouping Cases**
```js
let grade = 'B';

switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
    case 'B':
    case 'C':
        console.log("Passed");
        break;
    case 'D':
    case 'F':
        console.log("Failed");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Invalid Grade");
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Passed
```
### **Explanation:**
- `case 'A'`, `case 'B'`, and `case 'C'` **fall through** to execute the same code (`console.log("Passed")`).
- `case 'D'` and `case 'F'` **fall through** to execute (`console.log("Failed")`).

## **Key Takeaways**
✅ Fall through occurs when a case **does not have a break** and execution continues to the next case.  
✅ It can cause **unexpected behavior** if not handled properly.  
✅ To **prevent fall through**, always use `break` unless intentionally needed.  
✅ **Useful for grouping cases** that share the same logic.
