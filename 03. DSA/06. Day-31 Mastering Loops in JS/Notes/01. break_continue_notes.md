# 🔥 **Break and Continue in JavaScript – In-Depth Explanation**  

## 📌 **1. Introduction**  
In JavaScript, `break` and `continue` are control statements used within loops to alter their normal execution flow.  

- `break` 👉 Terminates the loop entirely when a specified condition is met.  
- `continue` 👉 Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.  

Both statements help in controlling the flow of a loop efficiently based on certain conditions. Let's understand each in depth with examples.  

---

## 📌 **2. The `break` Statement**  

### ✅ **Definition:**  
The `break` statement is used to **immediately exit the loop** when a specific condition is met. The program then continues executing the code after the loop.  

### 🛠 **How `break` Works:**  
1. The loop starts execution normally.  
2. When the loop reaches the `break` statement, it stops immediately.  
3. Any code after `break` inside the loop is skipped.  
4. Execution resumes after the loop.  

### 🚀 **Example of `break` in a loop:**  
```javascript
// Example: Using break in a for loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 15; i++) {
  if (i == 7) break;  // Loop stops when i == 7
  console.log("Hello", i);
}
console.log("Loop ended");
```
### 🔍 **Explanation:**  
- The loop runs from `1 to 15`.  
- When `i == 7`, the `break` statement executes, **terminating the loop immediately**.  
- So, the output will be:  
  ```
  Hello 1
  Hello 2
  Hello 3
  Hello 4
  Hello 5
  Hello 6
  Loop ended
  ```
- The numbers after `7` are **not printed** because the loop **stopped** due to `break`.  

---

## 📌 **3. The `continue` Statement**  

### ✅ **Definition:**  
The `continue` statement **skips** the current iteration of the loop when a condition is met but **does not terminate the loop**. The next iteration starts normally.  

### 🛠 **How `continue` Works:**  
1. The loop starts execution normally.  
2. When the loop reaches the `continue` statement, the current iteration is skipped.  
3. The next iteration starts immediately.  
4. Execution continues until the loop condition is false.  

### 🚀 **Example of `continue` in a loop:**  
```javascript
// Example: Using continue in a for loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i == 7) continue;  // Skip iteration when i == 7
  console.log("Hello", i);
}
console.log("Loop completed");
```
### 🔍 **Explanation:**  
- The loop runs from `1 to 10`.  
- When `i == 7`, the `continue` statement **skips that iteration** and moves to `i = 8`.  
- The numbers except `7` are printed.  
- The output will be:  
  ```
  Hello 1
  Hello 2
  Hello 3
  Hello 4
  Hello 5
  Hello 6
  Hello 8
  Hello 9
  Hello 10
  Loop completed
  ```
- Notice that `Hello 7` **is missing** because that iteration was skipped.

## 📌 **4. Key Differences Between `break` and `continue`**  

| Feature          | `break` 🛑 | `continue` 🔄 |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Effect on loop  | Stops the loop completely 🚫 | Skips only the current iteration ⏩ |
| Execution after statement | Execution moves to the code after the loop 📌 | Execution moves to the next iteration of the loop 🔁 |
| Used for       | Exiting the loop early when a condition is met ✅ | Skipping certain values while continuing the loop 🔥 |
| Example Use Case | Exiting a loop when a number is found 🎯 | Skipping unwanted numbers in a loop (like skipping even numbers) 🎭 |

---

## 📌 **5. Practical Examples of `break` and `continue`**  

### ✅ **Example 1: Stopping loop when number 5 is found (`break`)**
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) break;  
  console.log("Number:", i);
}
console.log("Loop stopped at 5");
```
### 📝 **Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Loop stopped at 5
```
📌 **Explanation:** The loop stops completely when `i == 5`.

---

### ✅ **Example 2: Skipping multiples of 3 (`continue`)**
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 3 == 0) continue;  
  console.log("Number:", i);
}
console.log("Loop completed");
```
### 📝 **Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 4
Number: 5
Number: 7
Number: 8
Number: 10
Loop completed
```
📌 **Explanation:** Numbers `3, 6, 9` are skipped because they are multiples of `3`.

## 📌 **6. When to Use `break` and `continue`?**
✅ **Use `break` when:**  
- You want to **exit the loop early** based on a condition.  
- Searching for a specific value and stopping once found.  
- Preventing unnecessary iterations.  

✅ **Use `continue` when:**  
- You want to **skip specific iterations** without stopping the loop.  
- Filtering out unwanted values (e.g., skipping even numbers, skipping invalid inputs).  
- Controlling loop execution dynamically.  

---

## 📌 **7. Summary**
1️⃣ **`break`** 👉 Stops the loop completely when a condition is met.  
2️⃣ **`continue`** 👉 Skips the current iteration but continues the loop.  
3️⃣ `break` is useful for stopping a loop early, while `continue` is used for skipping unwanted iterations.  
4️⃣ Use **`break`** when searching for an element in an array, and **`continue`** when filtering numbers or skipping specific conditions.
