
# 📄 GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) — **Optimal Euclidean Algorithm** (Using `%` modulo)

---

## 1. Code:

```javascript
// GCD Optimal using Euclidean Algorithm (Modulo Method)

let a = 16, b = 24;

while (a != 0 && b != 0) {
    if (a > b) {
        a = a % b;
    } else {
        b = b % a;
    }
}

console.log(a + b); 
```

---

## 2. **What This Code Does:**

- This code finds the **GCD of two numbers** using a more **optimal** version of the **Euclidean Algorithm**.
- Instead of repeated subtraction, it uses **modulo operation (%)** which is much faster.
- The loop continues **until either `a` or `b` becomes 0**.
- Finally, it prints `a + b` (because one will be `0`, and the other will be the **GCD**).

## 3. **Algorithm Step-by-Step:**

| Step | `a` | `b` | Action |
|:----:|:---:|:---:|:------|
| 1 | 16 | 24 | `a < b`, so `b = b % a` → `24 % 16 = 8` |
| 2 | 16 | 8 | `a > b`, so `a = a % b` → `16 % 8 = 0` |
| 3 | 0 | 8 | Loop stops (since `a == 0`) |

✅ Final GCD = `a + b = 0 + 8 = 8`

---

## 4. **Full Execution Trace (Detailed):**

- `a = 16`, `b = 24`
  - `a < b` → `b = b % a` → `b = 24 % 16 = 8`
- `a = 16`, `b = 8`
  - `a > b` → `a = a % b` → `a = 16 % 8 = 0`
- `a = 0`, `b = 8`
  - **Exit loop** (`a == 0`)
- Output → `a + b = 0 + 8 = 8`

✅ So GCD = **8**

## 5. **Call Stack Management:**

> Since this is using a `while` loop (not recursion), **no recursion stack** is involved.
>  
> **It uses Iteration**, where variables `a` and `b` update their values inside the loop.

## 6. **Key Observations:**

| Topic | Detail |
|:------|:-------|
| Why `a+b`? | At end, one of them is 0, other is the GCD |
| Base condition | Loop runs while `a != 0 && b != 0` |
| Modulo usage | Reduces values faster than subtraction |
| Time Complexity | O(log(min(a, b))) — Very fast |
| Space Complexity | O(1) — No extra space |

✅ Your code is **perfect and optimal** for finding GCD!  
✅ It uses the **fastest method** based on **Modulo operation**.  
✅ Output for `a=16`, `b=24` is **8**.
