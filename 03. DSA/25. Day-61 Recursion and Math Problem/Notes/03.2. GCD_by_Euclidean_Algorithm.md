
# ðŸ“œ GCD using Recursion â€” Euclidean Algorithm (Subtraction Method)

---

## 1. Code:

```javascript
let a = 18, b = 28;

while (a != b) {
    if (a > b) {
        a = a - b;
    } else {
        b = b - a;
    }
}

console.log(a);
```

---

## 2. What This Code Does:

- You are using the **Euclidean Algorithm** (specifically the **subtraction method**) to find the **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)** of two numbers `a` and `b`.
- The idea:
  - Keep subtracting the smaller number from the bigger one.
  - Eventually, both numbers will become **equal**.
  - That number is the **GCD**.

## 3. Step-by-Step Working for `a = 18`, `b = 28`:

| Step | a | b | Action |
|:----:|:--:|:--:|:------|
| 1 | 18 | 28 | `b = b - a` â†’ `b = 28 - 18 = 10` |
| 2 | 18 | 10 | `a = a - b` â†’ `a = 18 - 10 = 8` |
| 3 | 8 | 10 | `b = b - a` â†’ `b = 10 - 8 = 2` |
| 4 | 8 | 2 | `a = a - b` â†’ `a = 8 - 2 = 6` |
| 5 | 6 | 2 | `a = a - b` â†’ `a = 6 - 2 = 4` |
| 6 | 4 | 2 | `a = a - b` â†’ `a = 4 - 2 = 2` |
| 7 | 2 | 2 | `a == b`, loop breaks |

âœ… Now, `a = b = 2`, so **GCD is 2**.

## 4. Output:

```
2
```

## 5. Visualization:

```
a = 18, b = 28
â†“
b = 10
â†“
a = 8
â†“
b = 2
â†“
a = 6
â†“
a = 4
â†“
a = 2
â†“
a == b â†’ GCD = 2
```

## 6. Important Points:

| Point | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Algorithm used | Euclidean Algorithm (Subtraction version) |
| When it stops | When `a == b` |
| GCD | The final value of `a` (or `b`) |
| Time Complexity | Worst case O(max(a, b)) |
| Works for | Positive integers only |

## 7. Note:
- This **subtraction method** is easy to understand, but for very large numbers, itâ€™s slower.
- A **faster version** uses the `%` (modulo) operator instead of repeated subtraction.

âœ… Faster version:
```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    if (b == 0) return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

console.log(gcd(18, 28)); // Output: 2
```

# ðŸŽ¯ Final Conclusion:

**Your current code is correct** and it correctly finds the GCD by subtraction!  
**Output for (18,28) = 2** âœ…
