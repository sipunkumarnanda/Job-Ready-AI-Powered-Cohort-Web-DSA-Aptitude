
# 📄 GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) — **Optimal Recursion Using Euclidean Algorithm**

---

## 1. Code:

```javascript
// GCD Optimal using Recursion (Modulo Method)

function gcd(a, b) {
    if (b == 0) return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

console.log(gcd(1, 7));
```

---

## 2. **What This Code Does:**

- This code finds the **GCD of two numbers** using **recursive function calls**.
- It uses the **Optimal Euclidean Algorithm** with **modulo operation (%)**.
- Base condition:  
  ➔ If `b == 0`, return `a` (because GCD(a, 0) = a).  
- Otherwise:  
  ➔ Keep calling `gcd(b, a % b)` recursively until `b == 0`.

---

## 3. **Algorithm Step-by-Step (for gcd(1, 7)):**

| Call | `a` | `b` | Action |
|:----:|:---:|:---:|:------|
| 1 | 1 | 7 | `b != 0`, call `gcd(7, 1%7)` |
| 2 | 7 | 1 | `b != 0`, call `gcd(1, 7%1)` |
| 3 | 1 | 0 | `b == 0`, return `a` (1) |

✅ So, **GCD(1,7) = 1**.

---

## 4. **Full Execution Trace:**

- Call 1: `gcd(1,7)`  
  ➔ Since `b ≠ 0`, call `gcd(7, 1%7)` → `gcd(7,1)`
- Call 2: `gcd(7,1)`  
  ➔ Since `b ≠ 0`, call `gcd(1, 7%1)` → `gcd(1,0)`
- Call 3: `gcd(1,0)`  
  ➔ Now `b == 0`, so return `a = 1`.

Finally, the recursion **unwinds** and the final result is **1**.

## 5. **Proper Call Stack Management:**

| Stack Step | Function Called | Status | Return |
|:----------:|:----------------|:-------|:------:|
| 1 | `gcd(1, 7)` | Waiting for `gcd(7,1)` |
| 2 | `gcd(7,1)` | Waiting for `gcd(1,0)` |
| 3 | `gcd(1,0)` | Base Case Hit → Return `1` |
| Back | `gcd(7,1)` receives `1` → returns `1` |
| Back | `gcd(1,7)` receives `1` → returns `1` |

✅ Finally, `console.log(1)` prints the result!

## 6. **Visual Recursion Tree:**

```
gcd(1, 7)
   ↓
gcd(7, 1)
   ↓
gcd(1, 0) → returns 1
```

## 7. **Key Points:**

| Topic | Detail |
|:------|:-------|
| Why base `b==0`? | If second number becomes 0, GCD is the first number |
| Why `gcd(b, a%b)`? | Reduces numbers fast, smaller at each step |
| Time Complexity | O(log(min(a, b))) |
| Space Complexity | O(log(min(a, b))) (because of recursion stack) |
| Advantage | Very fast, fewer steps |

# 🎯 Final Conclusion:

✅ **Your code is 100% correct and optimal!**  
✅ **Efficient for very large numbers** too because it uses modulo (%) recursion.  
✅ **GCD(1, 7) = 1** as expected.

# ✍️ In simple words:

> "**Keep swapping (b, a%b) until the second number becomes zero. The remaining first number is the GCD.**"
