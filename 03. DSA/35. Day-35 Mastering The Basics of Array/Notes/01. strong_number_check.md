# **Strong Number – Detailed Explanation and Code Breakdown**

## **What is a Strong Number?**
A **Strong Number** is a number in which the sum of the **factorial of each digit** is equal to the original number.

### **Example 1:**
**145** is a Strong Number because:  
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = **145**  

Since the sum equals the original number, **145 is a Strong Number**.

## **Understanding the Code**

```javascript
import PromptSync from "prompt-sync";
let prompt = PromptSync();
```
- **`prompt-sync`** is imported to take user input.
- **`prompt()`** is used to take input from the user.

---

### **Step 1: Taking Input and Initializing Variables**
```javascript
let n = Number(prompt("Enter a number : ")) 
let copy = n
let sum = 0
```
- **`n`** stores the user input as a number.
- **`copy`** keeps the original number safe, as we will modify `n` in the loop.
- **`sum`** is initialized to store the sum of factorials of the digits.

---

### **Step 2: Extracting Digits and Calculating Factorials**
```javascript
while(n > 0){
    let digit = n % 10
```
- Extracts the **last digit** of `n` using `n % 10`.

#### **Step 2.1: Calculating Factorial of the Digit**
```javascript
    let fact = 1
    for(let i = 1; i <= digit; i++){
        fact = fact * i 
    }
```
- Initializes `fact` to `1`.
- Uses a **loop from 1 to the digit** to calculate the **factorial of the digit**.

#### **Step 2.2: Adding Factorial to the Sum**
```javascript
    sum = sum + fact
    n = Math.floor(n / 10)
```
- Adds the **calculated factorial** to `sum`.
- Removes the **last digit** from `n` using `Math.floor(n / 10)`.

### **Step 3: Checking if the Number is Strong**
```javascript
console.log(`sum of factorial of each digits = ${sum}`);
(copy === sum) ? console.log("Strong Number") : console.log("Not a strong Number");
```
- If the **sum of factorials equals the original number**, it is a **Strong Number**; otherwise, it is **not**.

## **Example Execution**
### **Input:**  
```
Enter a number: 145
```
### **Calculation:**
```
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
```
### **Output:**  
```
sum of factorial of each digits = 145
Strong Number
```

## **Complexity Analysis**
- **Extracting each digit**: `O(d)` (where `d` is the number of digits).
- **Computing factorial**: `O(k!)` (where `k` is the largest digit, max is `9!`).
- **Overall Complexity**: **O(d × k!)**

Since `9! = 362880` is constant, this algorithm is **efficient for small numbers**.

---

## **Optimized Approach**
Instead of computing factorial in every iteration, **precompute factorials from 0 to 9** and store them in an array.

```javascript
let factorials = [1];
for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    factorials[i] = factorials[i - 1] * i;
}
```
This avoids recalculating factorials multiple times, improving performance.

## **Conclusion**
- A **Strong Number** is a number where the **sum of the factorial of each digit** equals the original number.
- The **brute force approach** calculates factorial for each digit, making it inefficient for large numbers.
- **Optimizing using precomputed factorials** reduces redundant calculations.
