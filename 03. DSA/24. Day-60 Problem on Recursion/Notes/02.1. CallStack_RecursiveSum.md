
## ✅ Function:

```javascript
function sum(n){
    if(n == 0) return 0;
    
    return n + sum(n - 1);
}

console.log(sum(5));
```

---

## 🧠 Goal:

We want to calculate the sum of first 5 natural numbers:
```
sum(5) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 15
```

## 🧱 What is the Call Stack?

The **call stack** is like a pile of plates:

- Every time you **call a function**, a plate goes on top of the stack.
- Once a function is **done (hits `return`)**, the plate is removed.

---

## 📦 How This Function Works Step-by-Step:

Let’s walk through it like a chain of thoughts that the computer has.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: `sum(5)` is called

```javascript
return 5 + sum(4)
```
But wait! Before we can return the answer, we need to **know what `sum(4)` is**. So we go deeper.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: `sum(4)` is called

```javascript
return 4 + sum(3)
```
Still don’t know `sum(3)`, so we go deeper again.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: `sum(3)` is called

```javascript
return 3 + sum(2)
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: `sum(2)` is called

```javascript
return 2 + sum(1)
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5: `sum(1)` is called

```javascript
return 1 + sum(0)
```

---

### 🔹 Step 6: `sum(0)` is called

This is our **base case**:

```javascript
if(n == 0) return 0;
```

We’ve reached the **bottom of the recursion**, so we return `0`.

Now we start going **back up**.

---

## ⬆️ Going Back Up (Stack Unwinds):

Now we substitute the returned values **step-by-step**.

---

### 🔁 `sum(0)` returns `0`

So now:
```javascript
sum(1) = 1 + 0 = 1
```

---

### 🔁 `sum(1)` returns `1`

So now:
```javascript
sum(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
```

---

### 🔁 `sum(2)` returns `3`

So now:
```javascript
sum(3) = 3 + 3 = 6
```

---

### 🔁 `sum(3)` returns `6`

So now:
```javascript
sum(4) = 4 + 6 = 10
```

---

### 🔁 `sum(4)` returns `10`

So finally:
```javascript
sum(5) = 5 + 10 = 15
```

---

### ✅ Final Output:
```javascript
console.log(sum(5)); // prints 15
```

## 🔄 Summary Flow (Super Simple View):

```plaintext
sum(5)
→ 5 + sum(4)
→ 5 + (4 + sum(3))
→ 5 + (4 + (3 + sum(2)))
→ 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + sum(1))))
→ 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + (1 + sum(0)))))
→ 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + (1 + 0))))
→ 5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + 1)))
→ 5 + (4 + (3 + 3))
→ 5 + (4 + 6)
→ 5 + 10
→ 15
```

## 🍭 Easy Analogy

Imagine you’re climbing down a staircase 🪜 until you hit the ground (`sum(0)`), and then on the way back up, you **pick up a number at each step** and add it to your total.
