## 🔁 Code Again (for reference):

```javascript
function printNum(n){
    if(n == 0) return;

    printNum(n - 1);
    console.log(n);
}

printNum(10);
```

## 🧠 Concept: What is the **Call Stack**?

The **Call Stack** is a data structure used by the JavaScript engine to **keep track of function calls**.

- **When a function is called**, it is **pushed onto the stack**.
- **When a function finishes**, it is **popped off** the stack.
- It follows **LIFO**: **Last In, First Out**

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Call Stack Execution

We’ll walk through this **visually and logically**.

---

### ✅ Step 1: `printNum(10)` is called

- Call stack:  
```
| printNum(10) |
```

- Inside `printNum(10)`:
  - `n = 10` → not zero, so it calls `printNum(9)`  
  - But it **waits for `printNum(9)` to finish first**

---

### ✅ Step 2: `printNum(9)` is called

- Call stack:
```
| printNum(10) |
| printNum(9)  |
```

- It calls `printNum(8)` and **waits**

---

### ✅ Continuing this pattern...

The stack grows like this:

```
| printNum(10) |
| printNum(9)  |
| printNum(8)  |
| printNum(7)  |
| printNum(6)  |
| printNum(5)  |
| printNum(4)  |
| printNum(3)  |
| printNum(2)  |
| printNum(1)  |
| printNum(0)  | ← Base Case
```

At `printNum(0)`, the condition `n == 0` is true, so it just returns `undefined` and **does not call further or print anything**.

---

### 🔙 Now the Stack Starts to **Pop and Execute `console.log(n)`**

We now **unwind** the stack (pop one-by-one):

---

### ⬅️ `printNum(0)` returns  
- Stack:
```
| printNum(10) |
| printNum(9)  |
...
| printNum(1)  |
```

### ⬅️ `printNum(1)` resumes
- `console.log(1)`
- Then `printNum(1)` **returns**
- Stack:
```
| printNum(10) |
| printNum(9)  |
...
| printNum(2)  |
```

### ⬅️ `printNum(2)` resumes
- `console.log(2)`
- Then returns
- Stack:
```
...
| printNum(3)  |
```

And so on...

---

### ⬅️ Eventually:
Each of these prints and pops:
```
console.log(3)
console.log(4)
console.log(5)
console.log(6)
console.log(7)
console.log(8)
console.log(9)
console.log(10)
```

Stack becomes empty after the final `printNum(10)` returns.

---

## 🧾 Final Output on Console:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

## 🧱 Summary Table

| Function Call | Action | Stack Change |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| `printNum(10)` | Called | Pushed |
| `printNum(9)` | Called | Pushed |
| ... | ... | ... |
| `printNum(0)` | Called | Pushed (then returns) |
| `printNum(1)` | Resumes → `console.log(1)` | Popped |
| `printNum(2)` | Resumes → `console.log(2)` | Popped |
| ... | ... | ... |
| `printNum(10)` | Resumes → `console.log(10)` | Popped |

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> In **recursive functions**, the call stack first **builds up** (deep recursive calls), then **unwinds** back (each call completes, prints, and pops off the stack).
