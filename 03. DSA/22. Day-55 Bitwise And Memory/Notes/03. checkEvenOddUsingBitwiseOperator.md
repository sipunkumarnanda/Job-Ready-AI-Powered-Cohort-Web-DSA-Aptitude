### **Check Even or Odd Using Bitwise Operator - Detailed Notes**

#### **Problem**: Determine if a number is even or odd using the **bitwise AND (`&`)** operator.

The **bitwise AND (`&`)** operator is a very efficient way to check whether a number is even or odd, based on the least significant bit (LSB) of the number. The LSB of an even number is always `0`, while the LSB of an odd number is `1`. By using this property, we can determine if a number is even or odd with a simple bitwise operation.

### **How the Bitwise AND Operator Works for Even/Odd Check**

- **Even Number**: If the LSB of a number is `0`, the number is even.
- **Odd Number**: If the LSB of a number is `1`, the number is odd.

The bitwise AND operation between the number and `1` helps us isolate the LSB:
- If the result is `0`, the number is even.
- If the result is `1`, the number is odd.

### **Steps for Checking Even/Odd Using Bitwise AND (`&`)**:

Letâ€™s walk through the example:
- `a = 8`

1. **Step 1: `(a & 1)`**
   - In this step, we perform the bitwise AND between `a` and `1`.
   - `a = 8`, in binary: `1000`
   - `1` in binary: `0001`
   - The result of the operation:
     ```
     1000  (binary for 8)
     & 0001  (binary for 1)
     -----
     0000  (result = 0)
     ```
   - Since the result is `0`, we know that `a` is an **even number**.

2. **Step 2: Compare Result**
   - The result of `(a & 1)` is `0`, so we print "even".

If the result were `1`, we would print "odd".

### **Detailed Table for Even/Odd Check Using Bitwise AND**

| Step | Operation  | Binary Representation | Result | Decimal Value |
|------|------------|-----------------------|--------|---------------|
| **Initial** | `a = 8` | `a = 1000` | `a = 8` | `a = 8` |
| **Step 1** | `a & 1` | `1000 & 0001 = 0000` | `0` | `0` (Even) |
| **Final Output** | Check Result | If result = `0` | Print "even" | Output: "even" |

### **Code Example**:

```javascript
let a = 8;

(a & 1) == 0 ? console.log("even") : console.log("odd");
```

### **Output**:
```
even
```

### **Explanation of Code**:
- **`a & 1`**: This operation checks the least significant bit (LSB) of the number `a`.
  - If `a` is even, `(a & 1)` results in `0` (since the LSB is `0`).
  - If `a` is odd, `(a & 1)` results in `1` (since the LSB is `1`).
- The ternary operator checks whether the result is `0`. If true, it prints `"even"`, otherwise `"odd"`.

### **Why Use Bitwise AND for Even/Odd Check?**

- **Efficiency**: The bitwise operation is very fast and efficient compared to traditional methods of checking even or odd (like using modulus `%`).
- **Low-level Optimization**: Bitwise operations are often used in low-level programming for optimizing performance, especially in embedded systems or situations where memory and processing power are constrained.

### **Final Notes on Using Bitwise AND for Even/Odd Check**:

- **Key Concept**: The least significant bit (LSB) of an even number is always `0`, and for odd numbers, it is always `1`.
- **Efficiency**: The bitwise AND operation is very fast (constant time O(1)), and it's a very compact way to determine if a number is even or odd.
- **Memory Usage**: This method is space-efficient as it uses constant space (O(1)).
- **When to Use**: Bitwise operations are especially useful when working with low-level systems, performance-critical applications, or when you need to optimize for speed and memory usage.

### **Conclusion**:

Using the **bitwise AND (`&`)** operator to check if a number is even or odd is an efficient and simple approach. It works by isolating the least significant bit of the number, which determines whether the number is even or odd. This method is widely used in systems where performance is critical, such as embedded systems, competitive programming, or performance-critical applications.
