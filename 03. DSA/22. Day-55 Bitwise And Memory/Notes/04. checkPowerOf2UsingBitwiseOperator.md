### Notes on "Check if a Number is a Power of 2 Using Bitwise Operator"

#### Concept:
To check if a number `n` is a power of 2, we use the bitwise operation `(n & (n - 1))`. This operation works because, for a number that is a power of 2, its binary representation has exactly one `1` bit, and subtracting 1 from such a number flips all the bits to the right of the `1` bit, including the `1` bit itself. When performing a bitwise AND between the number `n` and `n-1`, the result will be `0` if `n` is a power of 2.

#### Steps:

1. **Understanding the Binary Representation**:
   - Any number that is a power of 2 has exactly one bit set to `1`. For example:
     - `1` (2^0) → `0001` in binary
     - `2` (2^1) → `0010` in binary
     - `4` (2^2) → `0100` in binary
     - `8` (2^3) → `1000` in binary
   - Subtracting `1` from a number with only one `1` bit flips all bits to the right of the highest set bit, including the bit itself. For example:
     - `8 (1000)` - `1` → `7 (0111)`

2. **Bitwise Operation**:
   The expression `(n & (n - 1))` checks whether the result is `0`. If it is, then `n` is a power of 2. This is because only numbers that have exactly one `1` bit set will satisfy this condition.

#### Example Walkthrough:

```javascript
let n = 256;

((n & (n - 1)) == 0) ? console.log("Power of 2") : console.log("Not power of 2");
```

1. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - First, `n = 256`, which is `100000000` in binary (a power of 2).
   - Then `n - 1 = 255`, which is `11111111` in binary.
   - Perform the bitwise AND between `n` (256) and `n-1` (255):
     - `256 & 255 = 100000000 & 11111111 = 000000000` (result is 0).
   - Since the result is `0`, the condition evaluates to `true` and prints "Power of 2".

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - `n = 256` → `100000000` (binary)
   - `n - 1 = 255` → `11111111` (binary)
   - `n & (n - 1)` → `100000000 & 11111111` → `000000000` (binary, result is `0`).

#### Final Note:

- The bitwise operation `n & (n - 1)` is an efficient way to check whether a number is a power of 2 in constant time, i.e., O(1).
- It works because numbers that are powers of 2 have exactly one bit set to `1` in their binary representation. When you subtract `1` from such numbers, all the bits to the right of the set bit (including the set bit itself) are flipped, making the bitwise AND result zero.
