---

## ✅ **Objective**
This code takes an array of numbers and counts how many times each number appears, using the `Map` data structure.

---

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 🔹 1. **The Array**
```js
let arr = [1, 10, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 1, 1, 10]
```

- This is the input array where some numbers are repeated.
- We want to count **how many times each number occurs**.

---

### 🔹 2. **Create a Map**
```js
let map = new Map()
```

- We create an empty `Map` to store:
  - **Key** = element from the array
  - **Value** = number of times it appears

---

### 🔹 3. **Loop Through the Array**
```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (map.has(arr[i])) {
        map.set(arr[i], map.get(arr[i]) + 1)
    } else {
        map.set(arr[i], 1)
    }
}
```

#### 🔍 What’s happening?
- Loop through each element `arr[i]`:
  - ✅ If the number already exists in the `Map`, increase its count by 1.
  - ❌ If it doesn't exist yet, add it with an initial count of 1.

---

### 🔹 4. **Print the Result**
```js
console.log(map)
```

- This shows the final frequency count of each unique number.

## 🧪 Output

```
Map(5) {
  1 => 3,
  10 => 2,
  2 => 5,
  4 => 1,
  6 => 1
}
```

This means:
- `1` appeared 3 times
- `10` appeared 2 times
- `2` appeared 5 times
- `4` appeared 1 time
- `6` appeared 1 time

## 📌 Key Concepts

| Concept | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Map** | A collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique. |
| **map.set(key, value)** | Adds or updates a key with a value |
| **map.get(key)** | Retrieves the current value for a key |
| **map.has(key)** | Checks if a key exists in the map |
