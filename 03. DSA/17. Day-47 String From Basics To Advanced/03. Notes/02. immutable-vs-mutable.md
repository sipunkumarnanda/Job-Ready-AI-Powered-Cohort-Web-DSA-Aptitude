---

### 🔤 **What is a String in JavaScript?**

- A **string** is a **sequence of characters** used to represent text.
- Strings in JavaScript are **primitive data types**.
- Strings are **immutable**, meaning **they cannot be changed once created**.

---

## ❗️**Common Misconception**

> ❌ **Wrong:** Strings are arrays of characters  
> ✅ **Correct:** Strings are **not arrays**, but they show **array-like behavior**.

- Strings are **not arrays**, but:
  - You can access characters using indexing: `str[0]`
  - You **cannot modify** characters directly using the index: `str[0] = 'X'` ❌

## 🔍 **Immutability of Strings vs Mutability of Arrays**

### ✅ **Arrays are Mutable**

```js
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
console.log(`Before : ${arr}`);    // Before : 10,20,30,40,50

arr[3] = 100;
console.log(`After : ${arr}`);     // After : 10,20,30,100,50

console.log(`So Arrays are Mutable`);
```

> Arrays allow you to **change individual elements** directly.

---

### ❌ **Strings are Immutable**

```js
let s = "Sheriyans";
console.log(`Before : ${s}`);      // Before : Sheriyans

s[2] = 'X';
console.log(`After : ${s}`);       // After : Sheriyans

console.log(`So Strings are Immutable`);
```

> Attempting to change `s[2]` **does nothing**. The original string remains unchanged.

---

### 🔁 **Reassigning Strings Is Allowed**

```js
let name = "Sipun";
name = "Akankshya";
console.log(name);   // Akankshya
```

- This is **not mutation**, it's **reassignment**.
- You're assigning a **new string to the variable**, not modifying the old one.

## 🧠 **Why Are Strings Immutable in JS?**

- Strings are **primitive** → stored directly in memory → designed to be immutable.
- This improves:
  - **Security**: You don’t accidentally change shared strings.
  - **Performance**: Allows optimization under the hood.
  - **Predictability**: You always know a string hasn’t changed unless reassigned.

## 🔍 **Key Differences: Array vs String**

| Feature            | Array           | String          |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Mutable            | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No             |
| Indexing           | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes            |
| Change by Index    | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No             |
| Length Property    | ✅ `.length`     | ✅ `.length`      |
| Reassignment       | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes            |
