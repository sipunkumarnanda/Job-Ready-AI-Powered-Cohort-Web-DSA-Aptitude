# **Loops in JavaScript: Entry-Controlled & Exit-Controlled Loops**

## **Introduction to Loops**
Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, loops help in reducing redundancy and improving efficiency. 

### **Types of Loops in JavaScript**
Loops in JavaScript can be categorized into two types based on when the condition is checked:

1. **Entry-Controlled Loops**  
   - The condition is checked before entering the loop body.
   - If the condition is `false`, the loop body does not execute even once.
   - Example: `for` loop, `while` loop

2. **Exit-Controlled Loops**  
   - The loop body is executed at least once before the condition is checked.
   - If the condition is `false`, the loop will still execute once before terminating.
   - Example: `do-while` loop

## **1. Entry-Controlled Loops**
These loops check the condition **before** executing the body of the loop.

### **1.1. `for` Loop**
The `for` loop is commonly used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

**Syntax:**
```js
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
    // Code to be executed
}
```

**Working of `for` Loop:**
1. **Initialization**: A variable is initialized before the loop starts.
2. **Condition**: The loop runs as long as this condition is `true`.
3. **Execution**: The code inside the loop executes.
4. **Increment/Decrement**: The variable is updated after each iteration.
5. **Repeat**: The condition is checked again; if `true`, the loop continues.

**Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5**
```js
for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
    console.log(i);
}
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### **1.2. `while` Loop**
The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is **not known beforehand** and depends on a condition.

**Syntax:**
```js
while(condition){
    // Code to be executed
}
```

**Working of `while` Loop:**
1. The **condition is checked first**.
2. If `true`, the loop body executes.
3. The condition is checked again.
4. If `false`, the loop terminates.

**Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5**
```js
let i = 1;
while(i <= 5){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

**Key Points:**
- The loop might not execute if the condition is `false` initially.
- Suitable for cases where the number of iterations is uncertain.

## **2. Exit-Controlled Loops**
In exit-controlled loops, the loop body **executes at least once** before checking the condition.

### **2.1. `do-while` Loop**
The `do-while` loop guarantees that the loop executes **at least once**, even if the condition is `false`.

**Syntax:**
```js
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while(condition);
```

**Working of `do-while` Loop:**
1. The loop body executes **once** before checking the condition.
2. The condition is then evaluated.
3. If `true`, the loop continues.
4. If `false`, the loop stops.

**Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5**
```js
let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while(i <= 5);
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### **Example Where `do-while` Ensures Execution**
Consider a case where `while` loop does **not** execute:

```js
let i = 10;
while(i < 5){
    console.log(i); // This will not execute because condition is false
    i++;
}
```

Now using `do-while`:

```js
let i = 10;
do {
    console.log(i); // Executes once before checking condition
    i++;
} while(i < 5);
```

**Output:**
```
10
```

**Key Points:**
- The loop **executes at least once**.
- Used when execution must occur **before condition checking**.

## **Comparison Between Entry-Controlled and Exit-Controlled Loops**

| Feature            | Entry-Controlled Loops (`for`, `while`) | Exit-Controlled Loops (`do-while`) |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Condition Check   | Before loop execution            | After first iteration       |
| Execution Guarantee | May not execute even once       | Executes at least once      |
| Best Use Case     | When iterations depend on a condition being true from the start | When execution must happen at least once |

## **Choosing the Right Loop**
- **Use `for` loop** when you **know the number of iterations** in advance.
- **Use `while` loop** when you **don't know** the number of iterations beforehand.
- **Use `do-while` loop** when you want the loop to execute **at least once** regardless of the condition.

## **Conclusion**
Loops in JavaScript are crucial for executing repetitive tasks efficiently. Understanding **entry-controlled** and **exit-controlled** loops helps in choosing the right loop for the given problem. By practicing different loop structures, you can write optimized and clean code. ðŸš€
