# **Understanding String and Number Operations in JavaScript**  

## **📌 Basic Arithmetic Operation: Sum of Two Integers**
In JavaScript, when you perform an addition operation (`+`) on two integers, it behaves as a standard arithmetic operation.  

```js
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
console.log(a + b); // Output: 30
```
✅ Here, since both `a` and `b` are numbers, JavaScript performs **addition** and returns `30`.  

---

## **📌 Relationship Between Strings and Numbers in JavaScript**  

### **1️⃣ String + String = String (Concatenation)**
When two strings are added using the `+` operator, JavaScript **concatenates (joins) them instead of adding**.  

```js
let s1 = "Hello";
let s2 = "World";
console.log(s1 + s2); // Output: "HelloWorld"
```
✅ Here, `"Hello"` and `"World"` are joined together as a single string.

---

### **2️⃣ String + Number = String (Concatenation)**
When you add a **string** and a **number**, JavaScript **converts the number to a string** and then **concatenates them**.

```js
console.log("Hello" + 20); // Output: "Hello20"
```
✅ `"Hello"` is a string, `20` is converted to `"20"`, so `"Hello" + "20"` results in `"Hello20"`.

---

### **3️⃣ Number + Number = Number (Arithmetic Operation)**
When two numbers are added using the `+` operator, JavaScript performs normal addition.

```js
console.log(20 + 10); // Output: 30
```
✅ Since both values are numbers, JavaScript performs arithmetic addition.

---

## **⚠️ Common Mistake in String and Number Concatenation**
Consider the following example:

```js
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 20;
console.log("Sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + a + b);
```

### **🔴 Wrong Output:**
```
Sum of 10 and 20 is 1020
```

### **🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown**
Let's analyze how JavaScript processes this statement:

```js
console.log("Sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + a + b);
```
1. `"Sum of " + num1` → `"Sum of 10"`
2. `"Sum of 10" + " and "` → `"Sum of 10 and "`
3. `"Sum of 10 and " + num2` → `"Sum of 10 and 20"`
4. `"Sum of 10 and 20" + " is "` → `"Sum of 10 and 20 is "`
5. `"Sum of 10 and 20 is " + a` → `"Sum of 10 and 20 is 10"`
6. `"Sum of 10 and 20 is 10" + b` → `"Sum of 10 and 20 is 1020"`

🔴 **Mistake:** Since `"Sum of 10 and 20 is "` is a string, JavaScript treats `a` and `b` as **strings** instead of numbers, resulting in concatenation instead of addition.

---

## **✅ Correct Solution: Using Parentheses for Proper Addition**
To ensure proper arithmetic addition, we should **group `a + b` inside parentheses** so that JavaScript evaluates it first.

```js
console.log("Sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + (a + b));
```

### **✅ Correct Output:**
```
Sum of 10 and 20 is 30
```

### **🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown**
1. `"Sum of " + num1` → `"Sum of 10"`
2. `"Sum of 10" + " and "` → `"Sum of 10 and "`
3. `"Sum of 10 and " + num2` → `"Sum of 10 and 20"`
4. `"Sum of 10 and 20" + " is "` → `"Sum of 10 and 20 is "`
5. **`(a + b)` is evaluated first (10 + 20 = 30)**
6. `"Sum of 10 and 20 is " + 30` → `"Sum of 10 and 20 is 30"`

✅ Since `(a + b)` is enclosed in parentheses, JavaScript evaluates it **before** string concatenation.

---

## **🟢 Reverse Case: Number Addition Before String Concatenation**
Consider this example:

```js
console.log(a + b + " is sum of " + a + " and " + b);
```

### **✅ Correct Output:**
```
30 is sum of 10 and 20
```

### **🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown**
1. **`a + b` is evaluated first** → `10 + 20 = 30`
2. `30 + " is sum of "` → `"30 is sum of "`
3. `"30 is sum of " + a` → `"30 is sum of 10"`
4. `"30 is sum of 10" + " and "` → `"30 is sum of 10 and "`
5. `"30 is sum of 10 and " + b` → `"30 is sum of 10 and 20"`

✅ Here, since `a + b` appears **before** any string, JavaScript performs **addition first** before concatenation.

---

## **⚡ Key Takeaways**
1. **JavaScript treats the `+` operator as either addition or string concatenation depending on the data types involved.**
   - Number + Number = **Addition**
   - String + String = **Concatenation**
   - String + Number = **Concatenation (Number gets converted to String)**

2. **To force proper arithmetic operations, use parentheses (`()`).**
   - ❌ `"Sum of " + a + b` → Wrong (Concatenation)
   - ✅ `"Sum of " + (a + b)` → Correct (Addition first)

3. **JavaScript evaluates operations from left to right.**
   - If the first operand is a string, it forces concatenation for the rest.
   - If the first operand is a number, it tries to perform arithmetic until it encounters a string.

4. **Best Practice:** Always **group arithmetic operations inside parentheses** to avoid unintended concatenation.

---

## **🚀 Final Thought**
JavaScript's handling of numbers and strings with the `+` operator can be tricky. Using parentheses ensures that numbers are added before concatenation happens.  
Always remember **JavaScript evaluates from left to right**, so the type of the first operand often determines the result.

# **Understanding Type Coercion and Variable Swapping in JavaScript**  

## **📌 What is Type Coercion?**
Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the **automatic conversion of values from one data type to another** based on the operator used.  

### **🟢 Type Coercion with the `+` Operator**
The `+` operator can function in two different ways:  
1. **Arithmetic Addition** when both operands are numbers.  
2. **String Concatenation** when at least one operand is a string.  

```js
console.log(1 + 1);   // Output: 2 (Addition)
console.log(1 + "1"); // Output: "11" (String Concatenation)
```
✅ Here, `"1"` (string) is concatenated with `1`, resulting in `"11"` (string).  

---

### **🟢 Type Coercion with the `-` Operator**
The `-` operator always performs **subtraction**, even if a string contains a number.

```js
console.log(1 - 1);    // Output: 0
console.log(1 - "1");  // Output: 0 (String "1" is converted to number 1)
```
✅ Unlike `+`, the `-` operator does not perform concatenation; instead, it converts strings to numbers.

---

### **🟢 Type Coercion with Multiplication and Division**
Operators like `*` and `/` also convert string numbers into actual numbers before performing the operation.

```js
console.log(2 * "5"); // Output: 10 (String "5" is converted to 5)
console.log(5 / "2"); // Output: 2.5 (String "2" is converted to 2)
```
✅ JavaScript automatically converts `"5"` and `"2"` into numbers before performing the multiplication and division.

---

### **📌 User Input and Type Coercion**
JavaScript `prompt()` takes input as a string by default. To ensure that numerical operations work correctly, we need to **convert the input to a number** using `Number()`.

```js
// let age = Number(prompt("Enter your age: "));
// console.log(age);
```
✅ `Number(prompt(...))` ensures the input is converted into a numeric value instead of a string.

---

## **⚡ Key Takeaways**
1. **Type coercion** occurs when JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another based on the operator used.
2. The `+` operator performs **concatenation** if at least one operand is a string.
3. The `-`, `*`, and `/` operators convert strings to numbers before performing arithmetic operations.
4. **Always convert user input (`prompt()`) to a number** using `Number()` before performing arithmetic operations.
5. **Swapping values can be done in multiple ways**, including:
   - Using a **temporary variable** (traditional approach).
   - Using **destructuring assignment** (modern ES6 approach).
   - Using **arithmetic operations** (without a third variable).

🚀 **Mastering these concepts is essential for writing efficient and bug-free JavaScript code!**

# **🔄 Swapping Two Variables in JavaScript (3 Methods) 🔄**  

Swapping two variables means exchanging their values. In JavaScript, there are multiple ways to swap values between two variables.  

---

## **📌 Method 1: Using a Temporary (Third) Variable**  
This is the traditional and simplest way to swap two variables.  

### **✅ Steps:**  
1. Store the value of one variable in a **temporary variable**.  
2. Assign the second variable’s value to the first variable.  
3. Assign the **temporary variable’s value** to the second variable.  

### **🔹 Code Example:**
```js
let var1 = 10;
let var2 = 20;

let temp = var2;  // Store var2 in temp
var2 = var1;      // Assign var1 value to var2
var1 = temp;      // Assign temp (previous var2) to var1

console.log(var1, var2); // Output: 20 10
```
**➡️ Explanation:**  
- `temp` stores the initial value of `var2` (20).  
- `var2` is updated with the value of `var1` (10).  
- `var1` gets the original value of `var2` (20) from `temp`.  

📌 **This method is easy to understand but requires an extra variable.**

---

## **📌 Method 2: Swapping Without a Third Variable (Using Arithmetic Operations)**  
This method swaps two variables without using any extra memory.  

### **✅ Steps:**  
1. Add both variables and store the result in one of them.  
2. Subtract one variable from the sum to get the other variable’s value.  
3. Repeat the subtraction to swap values.  

### **🔹 Code Example:**
```js
let var1 = 10;
let var2 = 20;

var2 = var1 + var2; // var2 = 10 + 20 = 30
var1 = var2 - var1; // var1 = 30 - 10 = 20
var2 = var2 - var1; // var2 = 30 - 20 = 10

console.log(var1, var2); // Output: 20 10
```
**➡️ Explanation:**  
- `var2` stores the sum of both numbers.  
- `var1` is updated to hold the original `var2` value.  
- `var2` is updated to hold the original `var1` value.  

📌 **Pros:** No extra variable needed.  
📌 **Cons:** May cause issues with large numbers due to integer overflow.

---

## **📌 Method 3: Swapping Using Destructuring Assignment (ES6 Feature)**  
JavaScript ES6 introduced **array destructuring**, which makes swapping variables extremely simple and readable.  

### **✅ Steps:**  
1. Use **array destructuring** to swap values in a single line.  

### **🔹 Code Example:**
```js
let var1 = 10;
let var2 = 20;

[var1, var2] = [var2, var1];

console.log(var1, var2); // Output: 20 10
```
**➡️ Explanation:**  
- JavaScript **creates an array** `[var2, var1]` and then **unpacks** the values into `var1` and `var2`.  
- `var1` gets `var2`’s value, and `var2` gets `var1`’s value—**all in one step!**  

📌 **Pros:**  
✔️ Clean and easy-to-read syntax.  
✔️ No extra memory usage.  
✔️ No risk of overflow errors.  

📌 **Cons:**  
❌ Requires ES6 support (Not an issue in modern JavaScript).  

---

## **⚡ Key Takeaways**
1. **Using a third variable** is the simplest and most readable approach.  
2. **Using arithmetic operations** saves memory but can cause integer overflow in large numbers.  
3. **Using destructuring assignment** is the **best and modern** approach, offering cleaner syntax with no extra memory usage.  

💡 **Recommended Approach:** Use **destructuring assignment** (`[a, b] = [b, a]`) for swapping in modern JavaScript! 🚀

# **🔢 JavaScript Operators and Their Usage 🔢**  

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript supports various types of operators, including **arithmetic, relational, and logical operators**.  

---

## **📌 1. Arithmetic Operators**  
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.  

### **✅ List of Arithmetic Operators**  
| Operator | Description | Example | Output |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| `+` | Addition | `10 + 20` | `30` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `10 - 20` | `-10` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `10 * 20` | `200` |
| `/` | Division | `10 / 20` | `0.5` |
| `%` | Modulus (Remainder) | `10 % 20` | `10` |

### **🔹 Code Example:**
```js
let a = 10;
let b = 20;

console.log(a + b);  // 30
console.log(a - b);  // -10
console.log(a * b);  // 200
console.log(a / b);  // 0.5
console.log(a % b);  // 10
```

### **⚡ Important Notes on Division (`/`) and Modulus (`%`)**  
- **Integer division results in a float.**  
```js
console.log(10 / 3); // Output: 3.333...
```
- **To remove the decimal, use `Math.floor()`**
```js
console.log(Math.floor(10 / 3));  // Output: 3
```
- **The modulus operator returns the remainder after division.**
```js
console.log(4 % 10);  // Output: 4
```

---

## **📌 2. Relational (Comparison) Operators**  
Relational operators **compare two values** and return `true` or `false`.  

### **✅ List of Relational Operators**  
| Operator | Description | Example | Output |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| `>` | Greater than | `10 > 8` | `true` |
| `<` | Less than | `10 < 8` | `false` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `10 >= 8` | `true` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `10 <= 8` | `false` |

### **🔹 Code Example:**
```js
console.log(10 > 8);  // true
console.log(10 < 8);  // false
console.log(10 >= 8); // true
console.log(10 <= 8); // false
```

📌 **Comparing values vs. values + types:**  
- `==` checks **only values** (performs type coercion).  
- `===` checks **both values and types** (strict comparison).  

```js
console.log(10 == "10");  // true  (Only checks value)
console.log(10 === "10"); // false (Checks both value and type)
```

---

## **📌 3. Logical Operators**  
Logical operators combine multiple conditions and return `true` or `false`.  

### **✅ List of Logical Operators**  
| Operator | Description | Example | Output |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| `&&` | Logical AND | `true && true` | `true` |
| `||` | Logical OR | `true || false` | `true` |
| `!` | Logical NOT | `!true` | `false` |

### **🔹 Code Example:**
```js
console.log(10 > 8 && 9 > 5 && 17 < 7);  // false (All must be true)
console.log(10 < 8 || 9 > 5 || 17 < 7);  // true (Only one needs to be true)
```
- `&&` (AND) → **Returns `true` only if all conditions are true.**  
- `||` (OR) → **Returns `true` if at least one condition is true.**  
- `!` (NOT) → **Reverses the condition (true → false, false → true).**

---

## **🎯 Summary**  
✔️ **Arithmetic operators** perform mathematical calculations.  
✔️ **Relational operators** compare values and return `true` or `false`.  
✔️ **Logical operators** combine multiple conditions to determine a final result.  
✔️ `==` checks only **value**, whereas `===` checks both **value and type**.  

🚀 **Practice these operators with different values to strengthen your understanding!**

# **🔢 Unary Operators in JavaScript 🔢**  

Unary operators are operators that **work with a single operand**. The most commonly used unary operators in JavaScript are **increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`)**.  

---

## **📌 1. Increment (`++`) Operator**  
The **increment operator (`++`) increases the value of a variable by `1`**. It can be used in two ways:  

| Type | Description | Example | Effect |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Pre-increment (`++x`)** | Increments `x` first, then returns the updated value | `let y = ++x;` | `x` and `y` both increase immediately |
| **Post-increment (`x++`)** | Returns `x` first, then increments `x` | `let y = x++;` | `x` increases after returning the old value |

### **🔹 Code Example:**
```js
let x = 10;
let y = ++x;  // Pre-increment
console.log(x, y);  // Output: 11, 11

let a = 10;
let b = a++;  // Post-increment
console.log(a, b);  // Output: 11, 10
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- **Pre-increment (`++x`)**: First, `x` is incremented (`10 → 11`), then `y` gets the updated value (`y = 11`).  
- **Post-increment (`x++`)**: First, `b` gets the old value of `a` (`b = 10`), then `a` is incremented (`10 → 11`).  

---

## **📌 2. Decrement (`--`) Operator**  
The **decrement operator (`--`) decreases the value of a variable by `1`**.  

| Type | Description | Example | Effect |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Pre-decrement (`--x`)** | Decreases `x` first, then returns the updated value | `let y = --x;` | `x` and `y` both decrease immediately |
| **Post-decrement (`x--`)** | Returns `x` first, then decrements `x` | `let y = x--;` | `x` decreases after returning the old value |

### **🔹 Code Example:**
```js
let p = 10;
let q = --p;  // Pre-decrement
console.log(p, q);  // Output: 9, 9

let m = 10;
let n = m--;  // Post-decrement
console.log(m, n);  // Output: 9, 10
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- **Pre-decrement (`--x`)**: First, `p` is decremented (`10 → 9`), then `q` gets the updated value (`q = 9`).  
- **Post-decrement (`x--`)**: First, `n` gets the old value of `m` (`n = 10`), then `m` is decremented (`10 → 9`).  

---

## **📌 3. Complex Expression Example**  
When unary operators are combined in expressions, they follow operator precedence.  

### **🔹 Code Example:**
```js
let z = 20;
console.log(z++ + ++z);  // Output: 20 + 22 = 42
```
📌 **Step-by-step evaluation:**  
1. `z++` → Post-increment: First, `z = 20` is used, then `z` is incremented (`20 → 21`).  
2. `++z` → Pre-increment: First, `z` is incremented (`21 → 22`), then used in the expression.  
3. `console.log(20 + 22);` → `42`  

---

## **🎯 Summary**  
✔️ **Pre-increment (`++x`)** → Increments first, then returns the new value.  
✔️ **Post-increment (`x++`)** → Returns the current value, then increments.  
✔️ **Pre-decrement (`--x`)** → Decrements first, then returns the new value.  
✔️ **Post-decrement (`x--`)** → Returns the current value, then decrements.  
✔️ **In complex expressions**, operations execute based on operator precedence.  

🚀 **Practice these unary operators with different values to understand how they work!**
