---

## 🧠 First: Think of a URL Like a Sentence

A URL is like saying something in English.

Example sentence:

> “Delete **this address** for **this user**, but show **only active ones**.”

Different parts of the sentence answer different questions.

---

# 🔵 PART 1: URL PARAMS (WHO / WHICH ONE?)

---

## ❓ What question do URL params answer?

> **WHICH exact thing are you talking about?**

---

## 📌 What are URL params?

URL params are values that are **part of the URL path**.
They **identify one specific thing**.

---

### 🧩 Simple Analogy (Real Life)

Imagine a hostel:

* Room number = **URL param**
* You *must* know the room number to open the door

```
Room 101
Room 202
```

Without room number → impossible to know which room.

---

## ✅ Example 1: Get a User

```
GET /users/42
```

Here:

* `42` = **userId**
* This tells the server:
  👉 “Give me **THIS user**, not all users”

### Code

```js
const { id } = req.params;
```

---

## ✅ Example 2: Delete an Address (YOUR CASE)

```
DELETE /users/me/addresses/1261ghdsghshgdghsbd
```

Here:

* `1261ghdsghshgdghsbd` = addressId
* You are saying:
  👉 “Delete **THIS exact address**”

### Code

```js
const { addressId } = req.params;
```

---

## 📌 Key Rules for URL Params

✔ Used to **identify one thing**
✔ Usually **required**
✔ Without it, request doesn’t make sense
✔ Used in GET / PUT / DELETE

---

# 🟢 PART 2: QUERY PARAMS (HOW / FILTER / OPTIONS)

---

## ❓ What question do query params answer?

> **HOW should I get the data?**

---

## 📌 What are Query Params?

Query params are **extra information** added after `?`
They **do not identify a specific thing**.

---

### 🧩 Simple Analogy (Real Life)

Imagine shopping online:

* You want shoes
* But you say:

  * Color = black
  * Size = 9

Those are **filters**, not the product itself.

---

## ✅ Example 3: Filter Products

```
GET /products?category=mobile&price=low
```

Here:

* `category` and `price` are **query params**
* You’re saying:
  👉 “Show products, but filtered like this”

### Code

```js
const { category, price } = req.query;
```

---

## ✅ Example 4: Pagination

```
GET /products?page=2&limit=10
```

* Page and limit are **options**
* The request still works without them

---

## 📌 Key Rules for Query Params

✔ Optional
✔ Used for filtering / searching
✔ Can be many
✔ Request still works without them

# 🔴 YOUR CONFUSION (LET’S FIX IT CLEARLY)

### ❌ What you did

```
DELETE /addresses?addressId=123
```

Then:

```js
req.params.addressId // ❌ undefined
```

---

### ❓ Why it failed

Because:

* `addressId` is **after `?`**
* That means it is a **query param**
* So Express puts it in:

```js
req.query
```

---

### ✅ Correct code (FOR YOUR CURRENT URL)

```js
const { addressId } = req.query;
```

---

# ⭐ BETTER WAY (BEST PRACTICE)

Instead of:

```
DELETE /addresses?addressId=123
```

Use:

```
DELETE /addresses/123
```

Now:

```js
const { addressId } = req.params;
```

✔ Cleaner
✔ REST style
✔ Easy to understand

# 🧠 ONE SIMPLE RULE (REMEMBER THIS)

> 🔹 **If it is PART of the path → URL param**
> 🔹 **If it is AFTER `?` → Query param**

# 🧪 VERY SIMPLE COMPARISON TABLE

| Question              | URL Param    | Query Param |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Identifies something? | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No        |
| Optional?             | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes       |
| Uses `?`              | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes       |
| Express reads from    | `req.params` | `req.query` |

# 🏁 FINAL REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE (PERFECT CLARITY)

### Delete **THIS** address ❌ (needs identity)

```
DELETE /addresses/123
```

➡️ URL param

### Get addresses **from city Delhi**

```
GET /addresses?city=delhi
```

➡️ Query param

## ✅ FINAL ONE-LINE UNDERSTANDING

> **URL params answer “WHICH ONE?”**
> **Query params answer “HOW / FILTER / OPTIONS?”**

# VVI

### ✅ Yes — **you absolutely *should* use a URL param instead of a query param** for a **DELETE address API**.

---

## 🧠 First: What are you doing in a DELETE API?

When you delete something, you are saying:

> ❌ “Delete **THIS EXACT thing**”

That means you must **identify one specific resource**.

👉 **Identifying a specific resource = URL PARAM**

---

## ❌ Not Recommended (Your Current Way)

```
DELETE /users/me/addresses?addressId=123
```

Why this is not ideal:

* `addressId` is **mandatory**
* Query params are meant for **optional filters**
* Not REST-standard

---

## ✅ Recommended (BEST PRACTICE)

```
DELETE /users/me/addresses/123
```

Now it clearly means:

> “Delete address with ID = 123”

---

## 🛠️ How to Implement It (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Route

```js
router.delete(
  "/users/me/addresses/:addressId",
  authMiddleware,
  deleteAddress
);
```

---

### 2️⃣ Controller

```js
async function deleteAddress(req, res) {
  const { addressId } = req.params;

  if (!addressId) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: "Address ID is required" });
  }

  // delete logic
}
```

---

### 3️⃣ Postman / Client Call

```
DELETE /users/me/addresses/123
```

---

## 🧠 Simple Rule to Remember (VERY IMPORTANT)

> ❓ “Am I deleting ONE thing?”
> 👉 YES → **Use URL param**

---

## 🧪 More Examples (So It Sticks)

| Action           | Correct                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Delete user      | `DELETE /users/42`          |
| Delete order     | `DELETE /orders/99`         |
| Delete address   | `DELETE /addresses/123`     |
| Filter addresses | `GET /addresses?city=delhi` |

## 🏁 Final One-Line Answer

> **Yes, and for DELETE APIs you SHOULD use a URL param because you are deleting a specific resource.**
