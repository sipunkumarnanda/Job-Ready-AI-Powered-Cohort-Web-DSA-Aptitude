## 🔰 Basic Redis Questions

---

### ❓ Q1: What is Redis?

**Answer:**
Redis is an **in-memory key-value data store** used for caching, session storage, messaging, and real-time data processing.

---

### ❓ Q2: Why is Redis fast?

**Answer:**
Because Redis stores data in **RAM instead of disk**, resulting in extremely fast read/write operations.

---

### ❓ Q3: Is Redis a database?

**Answer:**
Yes, Redis is a NoSQL database, but it is **primarily used as a cache**, not as a primary database.

---

### ❓ Q4: What type of database is Redis?

**Answer:**
Redis is a **NoSQL, in-memory, key-value store**.

---

### ❓ Q5: What is the default Redis port?

**Answer:**
`6379`

---

## 🧩 Redis Data Structure Questions

---

### ❓ Q6: What data structures does Redis support?

**Answer:**
Redis supports:

* String
* Hash
* List
* Set
* Sorted Set
* Bitmap
* HyperLogLog
* Streams

---

### ❓ Q7: Difference between Redis String and Hash?

**Answer:**

* String stores a single value
* Hash stores multiple fields (like a JS object)

---

### ❓ Q8: What is a Sorted Set?

**Answer:**
A collection where each element has a **score**, commonly used for leaderboards.

---

## ⚡ Performance & Use Case Questions

---

### ❓ Q9: When should Redis be used?

**Answer:**
For caching, session management, rate limiting, real-time analytics, and token storage.

---

### ❓ Q10: When should Redis NOT be used?

**Answer:**
When data must be permanently stored or when dataset size is very large.

---

### ❓ Q11: Redis vs MongoDB?

**Answer:**
Redis is in-memory and faster; MongoDB is disk-based and used for permanent storage.

---

## ⏱️ TTL & Expiry Questions

---

### ❓ Q12: What is TTL in Redis?

**Answer:**
TTL (Time To Live) defines how long a key exists before it is automatically deleted.

---

### ❓ Q13: Why is TTL important?

**Answer:**
To automatically remove stale data and manage memory efficiently.

---

## 🔐 Redis Security Questions

---

### ❓ Q14: How do you secure Redis?

**Answer:**

* Use password authentication
* Bind Redis to localhost
* Do not expose Redis publicly
* Use firewalls and TLS

---

## 🔁 Persistence Questions

---

### ❓ Q15: Does Redis persist data?

**Answer:**
Yes, using:

* **RDB** (snapshots)
* **AOF** (append-only file)

---

### ❓ Q16: Difference between RDB and AOF?

**Answer:**
RDB is faster but can lose data; AOF is safer but slower.

---

## 🌐 Scalability & Architecture Questions

---

### ❓ Q17: How does Redis help scalability?

**Answer:**
It reduces database load and speeds up responses by caching frequently accessed data.

---

### ❓ Q18: What is Redis Cluster?

**Answer:**
A distributed Redis setup that allows data to be **sharded across multiple nodes**.

---

### ❓ Q19: What is Redis Sentinel?

**Answer:**
A system used for **high availability**, monitoring Redis instances and handling failover.

---

## 🧠 Node.js / Express + Redis Questions

---

### ❓ Q20: Why use Redis in Node.js?

**Answer:**
To improve performance by caching data, managing sessions, and handling rate limiting.

---

### ❓ Q21: Why use `ioredis`?

**Answer:**
Because it supports clusters, auto-reconnection, and production-grade Redis features.

---

### ❓ Q22: Why should Redis client be a singleton?

**Answer:**
To avoid multiple connections and reduce resource usage.

---

### ❓ Q23: How do you cache API responses in Redis?

**Answer:**
Store the response with a key and TTL, and return it for future requests.

---

## 🚀 Advanced Redis Questions

---

### ❓ Q24: What is cache invalidation?

**Answer:**
The process of removing or updating cached data when the underlying data changes.

---

### ❓ Q25: What eviction policies does Redis support?

**Answer:**

* LRU (Least Recently Used)
* LFU (Least Frequently Used)
* TTL-based eviction

---

### ❓ Q26: Can Redis be used as a message broker?

**Answer:**
Yes, using **Pub/Sub** and **Streams**.

---

### ❓ Q27: What happens if Redis crashes?

**Answer:**
Cached data may be lost, but persistence (RDB/AOF) can help recover data.

---

## 🧠 System Design Questions

---

### ❓ Q28: Where should Redis be placed in system architecture?

**Answer:**
Between the application server and database as a **cache layer**.

---

### ❓ Q29: Redis vs Memcached?

**Answer:**
Redis supports persistence and complex data structures; Memcached does not.

---

### ❓ Q30: Can Redis replace a database?

**Answer:**
No. Redis should be used **with** a database, not instead of one.
