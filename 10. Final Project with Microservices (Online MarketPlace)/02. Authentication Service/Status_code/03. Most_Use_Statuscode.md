HTTP status codes are **numeric signals sent by a server** to tell the client **what happened to a request**.

They answer questions like:

* Was the request successful?
* Was the request wrong?
* Is the server broken?
* Should the client try again?

# ✅ **2xx – Success Status Codes**

These indicate the request was **received, understood, and processed successfully**.

---

## **200 – OK (Most Used Status Code)**

### Meaning

The request was **successful**, and the server returned the expected response.

### When to Use

Use **200** when:

* Data is fetched successfully
* An update succeeds
* An action completes successfully

### Examples

* `GET /users` → list of users returned
* `PUT /profile` → profile updated
* `POST /login` → login successful

### Key Notes

* Default success response
* Response body usually contains data
* Do **not** use for resource creation

---

## **201 – Created**

### Meaning

The request succeeded, and a **new resource was created**.

### When to Use

Use **201** when:

* A new record is created in the database
* Server generates a new resource ID

### Examples

* `POST /users` → new user created
* `POST /orders` → order created

### Key Notes

* Usually returned with a **Location header**
* Indicates permanent creation
* Better than 200 for POST-create operations

---

## **204 – No Content**

### Meaning

The request succeeded, but there is **nothing to return**.

### When to Use

Use **204** when:

* A delete operation succeeds
* An update succeeds but no data is needed

### Examples

* `DELETE /users/5`
* `PUT /settings` (no response body)

### Key Notes

* No response body allowed
* Cleaner for simple success actions
