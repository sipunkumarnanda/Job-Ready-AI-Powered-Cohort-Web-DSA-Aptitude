HTTP status codes are **standardized numeric responses** sent by a server to indicate the **result of a client’s request**.

They are grouped as:

* **2xx → Success**
* **4xx → Client Error**
* **5xx → Server Error**

## ✅ **200 – OK**

### Meaning

The request was **successful**, and the server returned the expected response.

### When to Use

Use **200** when:

* A resource is successfully **retrieved**
* A request is processed correctly
* Data is returned as expected

### Common Use Cases

* `GET /users/123` → User data returned
* `PUT /profile` → Profile updated and returned
* `POST` that performs an action but **does not create a new resource**

### Example

```http
GET /products/45
→ 200 OK
```

### Key Notes

* Most **frequently used** status code
* Response body usually contains data
* Do **not** use for creation (use 201 instead)

---

## 🆕 **201 – Created**

### Meaning

The request was successful, and a **new resource was created**.

### When to Use

Use **201** when:

* A `POST` request creates a **new resource**
* The server assigns a new identifier (ID)

### Common Use Cases

* Creating a user
* Creating an order
* Uploading a new document

### Example

```http
POST /users
→ 201 Created
Location: /users/124
```

### Key Notes

* Often includes a **Location header**
* Response body may include the created resource
* Do **not** use if nothing new is created

## ❌ **400 – Bad Request**

### Meaning

The request is **invalid or malformed**, and the server **cannot process it**.

### When to Use

Use **400** when:

* Required fields are missing
* Data format is incorrect
* Validation fails
* JSON is malformed

### Common Use Cases

* Missing required parameters
* Invalid email format
* Invalid data types

### Example

```http
POST /users
→ 400 Bad Request
{
  "error": "Email is required"
}
```

### Key Notes

* Client-side issue
* Client must **fix the request**
* Very common in APIs

## **🔐 401 – Unauthorized**

### **📌 Meaning**
Authentication is **missing or invalid**.

### **🕒 When to Use**
Use **401** when:
- 🔑 Authentication token is **missing**
- ❌ Token is **invalid**
- ⏰ Token is **expired**

### **📂 Examples**
- 🚫 Accessing a protected API **without logging in**
- 🔐 Using an **invalid API key**
- ⌛ Sending an **expired JWT token**

### **📝 Key Notes**
- 🚷 Means **not logged in**
- 🔄 Client must authenticate again
- 📡 Often returned with the **`WWW-Authenticate`** header

## 🔍 **404 – Not Found**

### Meaning

The server cannot find the requested **resource**.

### When to Use

Use **404** when:

* Resource does not exist
* URL is incorrect
* Resource was deleted or never created

### Common Use Cases

* User ID does not exist
* Invalid endpoint
* Deleted resource access

### Example

```http
GET /users/9999
→ 404 Not Found
```

### Key Notes

* Does **not** mean server is down
* Safe to expose publicly
* Do not use for authorization issues

---

## ⚠️ **409 – Conflict**

### Meaning

The request **conflicts with the current state** of the server.

### When to Use

Use **409** when:

* Duplicate resource creation
* Version conflicts
* State violations

### Common Use Cases

* Registering with an existing email
* Updating outdated version of data
* Unique constraint violations

### Example

```http
POST /users
→ 409 Conflict
{
  "error": "Email already exists"
}
```

### Key Notes

* Indicates logical conflict
* Client may retry with changes
* More precise than 400 in many cases

## 💥 **500 – Internal Server Error**

### Meaning

The server encountered an **unexpected error** and failed to process the request.

### When to Use

Use **500** when:

* Application crashes
* Unhandled exceptions
* Database or internal service failures

### Common Use Cases

* Null pointer exceptions
* Database connection failure
* Unexpected runtime errors

### Example

```http
GET /orders
→ 500 Internal Server Error
```

### Key Notes

* Server-side issue
* Do **not** expose internal error details
* Log errors internally for debugging

| Code | Name                  | Category     | When to Use               |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| 200  | OK                    | Success      | Request successful        |
| 201  | Created               | Success      | New resource created      |
| 400  | Bad Request           | Client Error | Invalid request data      |
| 404  | Not Found             | Client Error | Resource does not exist   |
| 409  | Conflict              | Client Error | Data/state conflict       |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Server Error | Unexpected server failure |

## 🧠 Best Practices

✔ Use **specific status codes** (409 instead of 400 when applicable)
✔ Keep **error messages clear but secure**
✔ Log **500 errors internally**, not to users
✔ Align status codes with **HTTP semantics**
✔ Be consistent across your API
