## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is IAM? ‚Äî Overview & purpose

**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is AWS‚Äôs centralized service for **authentication (who you are)** and **authorization (what you can do)**.
It controls who (identities) can access which AWS resources, under which conditions. IAM is foundational for cloud security: correctly designing IAM prevents data breaches and enforces least privilege.

**Two big goals**

* **Identify** principals (users, services, federated users) and authenticate them.
* **Authorize** those principals using policies, roles, and guardrails so they only perform permitted actions.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Core concepts ‚Äî identities & principals üßë‚Äçüíªü§ñ

### Users (üë§)

* Long-lived identities for humans or bots inside an AWS account.
* Can have **console passwords** (for web sign-in) and **access keys** (programmatic).
* Best practice: minimize use; prefer temporary credentials via roles.

### Groups (üë•)

* Collections of users to which **identity-based policies** can be attached.
* Simplifies permission management.
* **Note:** IAM groups **cannot** be nested.

### Roles (üé≠) ‚Äî the most powerful tool

* A **role** is a set of permissions **that a trusted entity can assume**.
* Roles have two important parts:

  * **Trust policy** (who can assume the role ‚Äî e.g., EC2, another account, a SAML/OIDC provider).
  * **Permission policy** (what the role is allowed to do once assumed).
* Roles issue **temporary credentials** (via STS). Use roles for EC2, Lambda, cross-account access, and federated users.
* **Instance profile** = wrapper that lets EC2 instances assume a role.

### Service principals (üîå)

* AWS services assume roles using a service principal (e.g., `ec2.amazonaws.com`, `lambda.amazonaws.com`).

### Federated identities & identity providers (ü™™)

* External identity providers (SAML, OIDC, Cognito) let corporate/third-party users access AWS **without** creating IAM users.
* Federation uses roles (AssumeRoleWithSAML / AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Policies ‚Äî the language of permissions üìú

IAM policies are JSON documents that **allow** or **deny** actions. There are several policy types:

### Identity-based policies

* **Managed policies** (AWS-managed or customer-managed): independently versioned documents you can attach to users, groups, or roles.

  * *AWS-managed* = maintained by AWS.
  * *Customer-managed* = you create and control them.
* **Inline policies**: embedded directly on a single user, group, or role (use sparingly‚Äîharder to track).

### Resource-based policies

* Policies attached to resources (S3 bucket policy, SQS, SNS, KMS key policy, Lambda resource policy).
* These include a **Principal** element (who is allowed) ‚Äî identity policies do **not** include `Principal`.
* Useful for cross-account access because the resource itself grants access.

### Other policy constructs

* **Permissions boundaries** ‚Äî maximum permissions an identity (user/role) can obtain. They *limit* what the identity can be granted (useful for delegating admin tasks safely).
* **Session policies** ‚Äî temporary inline policies you pass during `AssumeRole` to limit the session further.
* **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** ‚Äî part of AWS Organizations; set account-level guardrails that limit what principals in member accounts can do. SCPs **do not** grant permissions themselves ‚Äî they only *restrict* (allow list or deny).
* **S3 ACLs and legacy controls** ‚Äî older permission layer; prefer resource policies over ACLs when possible.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Anatomy of a policy ‚Äî fields & semantics üß©

Typical policy structure:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "OptionalStatementId",
      "Effect": "Allow" | "Deny",
      "Principal": { /* only in resource-based policies */ },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject" | ["s3:GetObject","s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*",
      "Condition": { "IpAddress": {"aws:SourceIp":"203.0.113.0/24"} }
    }
  ]
}
```

* **Effect**: `Allow` or `Deny`. `Deny` is explicit and overrides any Allow.
* **Action**: which API operations (or `*`) ‚Äî service-specific action names.
* **Resource**: ARN(s) the statement applies to. `*` matches all.
* **Condition**: extra constraints using condition keys (e.g., `aws:SourceIp`, `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent`, `aws:RequestTag/...`).
* **Principal**: identifies who the resource-based policy grants access to (users, accounts, services).

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Policy examples ‚Äî real snippets with explanations üõ†Ô∏è

**A. Read-only to a specific S3 bucket path**

```json
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":"s3:GetObject",
      "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/path/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

* Grants `GetObject` to objects under `my-bucket/path/`. Attach this to a role or user.

**B. Deny S3 deletes except from a specific IP range**

```json
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Deny",
      "Action":"s3:DeleteObject",
      "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
      "Condition":{"NotIpAddress":{"aws:SourceIp":"203.0.113.0/24"}}
    }
  ]
}
```

* Explicit Deny blocks deletes unless requests originate from that IP range.

**C. Trust policy for EC2 instance role**

```json
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal":{"Service":"ec2.amazonaws.com"},
      "Action":"sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

* Lets EC2 instances assume the role via instance profile.

**D. Cross-account trust (allow role from account 111122223333)**

```json
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal":{"AWS":"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ExternalRole"},
      "Action":"sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Policy evaluation ‚Äî rules & order of operations üß≠

Understanding evaluation prevents surprising denials.

**Simplified evaluation flow**

1. **Default Deny** ‚Äî everything is denied by default.
2. Evaluate all applicable policies (identity-based, resource-based, session policies, permissions boundaries, SCPs).
3. If **any** policy returns an **explicit Deny**, the request is denied.
4. If no explicit Deny, the request is allowed **only if** there is an **explicit Allow** from an identity-based or resource-based policy **and** that action is not blocked by an SCP or permissions boundary.
5. **SCPs**: act as a filter across accounts ‚Äî if the action is not allowed by the SCP, it cannot be allowed regardless of identity policies.
6. **Permissions boundary** restricts the maximum permissions an identity can get: even if a policy allows it, the permissions boundary can block it.

**Key takeaway:** `Explicit Deny > Allow`. Also, multiple policy types interact (identity + resource + org-level) ‚Äî always check all relevant policies in case of denials.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Temporary credentials & AWS STS (üîë short-lived security)

* **AWS STS (Security Token Service)** issues temporary credentials (AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, SessionToken) with limited lifetime.
* Common STS flows:

  * `AssumeRole` ‚Äî used for roles (cross-account, services, or within the same account).
  * `AssumeRoleWithSAML` ‚Äî SAML federation.
  * `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` ‚Äî OIDC / mobile identity providers (Google, Amazon, Cognito).
  * `GetSessionToken` ‚Äî MFA-based temporary tokens for IAM users.
* **Benefits**: short-lived credentials reduce blast radius of leaked keys and enable secure cross-account/service access.

**Example cross-account scenario**

1. Create a role in account B with a trust policy that allows account A‚Äôs principals to assume it.
2. From account A, call `aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::B:role/RoleName`.
3. Receive temporary credentials and perform permitted actions in account B.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Federation & Single Sign-On (SSO) üåê

* **SAML 2.0 federation**: enterprise IdP (Azure AD, Okta, ADFS) provides SAML assertions; AWS trusts them and issues temporary AWS credentials mapped to roles. Useful for corporate SSO.
* **OIDC / Web Identity**: mobile/web apps sign in with Google/Facebook/Cognito; exchange token for AWS temporary credentials.
* **AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)**: centralized sign-in to multiple AWS accounts, manage users & permission sets, map identities to roles in member accounts. (If you use a corporate IdP, Identity Center can integrate with it.)

**Important**: Federated users are authenticated externally and authorized via IAM roles ‚Äî you don't create IAM users for them.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Roles for AWS services ‚Äî common patterns üöÄ

* **EC2 instance role (instance profile)**: attach a role to EC2 so apps on the instance call AWS APIs without storing keys.
* **Lambda execution role**: the function assumes a role to access DynamoDB, S3, etc.
* **ECS task role**: grants permissions to containers.
* **Service-linked roles**: managed by AWS services to perform actions on your behalf (created automatically).
* **Best practice**: always prefer service roles over embedded credentials in code.

---

## üîü IAM tools, observability & auditing üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

* **CloudTrail** ‚Äî records all IAM and API activities; essential for forensics.
* **IAM Access Analyzer** ‚Äî finds resources that are shared with external principals and helps detect unintended access.
* **Policy Simulator** ‚Äî test policies and simulate API calls to see allow/deny outcomes.
* **Credential Report** ‚Äî CSV report listing all IAM principals and their credential status (last use, rotation).
* **Access Advisor** ‚Äî shows the last time a service was accessed by a principal (helps with removing unused permissions).
* **AWS Config** & **Security Hub** ‚Äî enforce and detect misconfigurations.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced features & patterns ‚öôÔ∏è

### Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

* Use tags on principals and resources, combined with variables like `${aws:PrincipalTag/Team}`, to create dynamic policies.
* Example: allow actions only if resource tag `Team=team-A` equals principal‚Äôs `Team` tag.

### Permission boundaries + delegated administration

* Give developers freedom to create roles/users but restrict them via permissions boundaries to prevent privilege escalation.

### Session policies & policy chaining

* Session policies allow further constraint during `AssumeRole` ‚Äî useful for temporary, fine-grained access.

### Key management (KMS) interplay

* KMS uses **key policies** (resource-based) plus IAM policies; KMS key policy can be authoritative ‚Äî be careful when designing KMS access.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Best practices & hardening checklist ‚úÖ

* **Root account**: enable MFA, do not use for daily tasks. Store root credentials securely and rarely use them.
* **Least privilege**: start with no access and add only what‚Äôs necessary.
* **Prefer roles & temporary credentials** over long-term access keys.
* **MFA**: enforce for interactive sign-ins and privileged operations (e.g., `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` conditions).
* **Rotate credentials** regularly and remove unused credentials promptly.
* **Avoid `*:*` policies** ‚Äî don‚Äôt grant `Action: "*"`, `Resource: "*"`.
* **Use SCPs & permissions boundaries** to enforce organization-wide guardrails.
* **Use IAM Access Analyzer and Policy Simulator** to validate policies before deployment.
* **Enable CloudTrail organization-wide**, monitor IAM changes, and set alerts for suspicious activities.
* **Use AWS Identity Center** or a corporate IdP for centralized authentication and role assignment.
* **Tag resources and enable ABAC** for scalable, attribute-based access.
* **Automate detection** of overly permissive policies and unused credentials.
* **Document role purpose and owners** ‚Äî make it clear who maintains each role/policy.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Common mistakes & anti-patterns üö´

* Using root credentials for day-to-day tasks.
* Embedding long-lived access keys in code, repos, or images (dangerous).
* Broad wildcard policies (`Action: "*", Resource: "*"`).
* Overly permissive trust policies (`Principal: "*"`) on roles/resource policies.
* Not rotating/revoking unused credentials.
* Forgetting to check Organization SCPs or permissions boundaries when debugging permission errors.
* Relying solely on ACLs instead of resource policies where appropriate.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting tips üîç

* If an action is denied:

  1. Check for **explicit Deny** in any policy (identity, resource, session, or SCP).
  2. Use **IAM Policy Simulator** with the principal and API call.
  3. Inspect CloudTrail to see the request and error details.
  4. Verify resource-based policy principals (correct account ID/ARN).
  5. Confirm no permission boundary or SCP is preventing the action.
  6. Check that the role was correctly assumed (valid session token & not expired).

## 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Practical examples & flows (quick reference)

* **Secure EC2 access to S3**: create role with `s3:GetObject` on bucket ‚Üí attach role via instance profile ‚Üí application uses SDK w/o keys.
* **Cross-account read access**: create role in account B with trust policy allowing account A‚Äôs users/roles ‚Üí attach S3 read policy to role ‚Üí account A assumes role.
* **SSO for employees**: configure corporate IdP (SAML) ‚Üí configure roles and attribute mappings ‚Üí users sign in via IdP and assume roles.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Limits & operational notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

* IAM has service quotas (max number of users, roles, policies attachments, policy size limits). These change over time ‚Äî check AWS docs or request quota increases from AWS Support when needed.
* Policies should be modular: prefer multiple focused policies over one huge policy for clarity and reusability.

---

## Wrap-up ‚Äî TL;DR üßæ

* **IAM = identity + authorization**: who can do what, where, and under which conditions.
* **Use roles + STS** for temporary access, avoid long-lived keys.
* **Design for least privilege**, use tools (Access Analyzer, Policy Simulator, CloudTrail) to test and monitor.
* **Use org-level guardrails** (SCPs, permission boundaries) to prevent privilege escalations across accounts.
* **Automate auditing and rotate credentials** regularly.
