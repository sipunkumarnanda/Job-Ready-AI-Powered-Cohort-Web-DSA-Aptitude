Managing your EC2 instances properly is important to **control costs** and **protect data**. Stopping an instance temporarily is different from terminating it permanently.

---

## 1️⃣ Stopping an EC2 Instance ⏸️

### What happens when you stop an instance:

* The **EC2 instance shuts down** safely.
* **EBS root volumes** remain attached, so your data is preserved.
* You **stop being charged for instance compute** (the running hours).
* Public IP may **change** (unless you use an Elastic IP).
* Instance state changes from `running` → `stopped`.

**When to stop an instance:**

* You don’t need it temporarily (e.g., off-hours or weekends).
* Want to save costs but **keep the OS and data** intact.

### Stop using AWS Console 🖱️

1. Go to **EC2 → Instances**
2. Select the instance → **Instance State → Stop Instance**
3. Confirm the action.

### Stop using AWS CLI 🖥️

```bash
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
```

* Replace `i-0123456789abcdef0` with your instance ID.
* Instance state changes to `stopping` → `stopped`.

## 2️⃣ Starting a Stopped EC2 Instance ▶️

When you need the instance again:

* You can **start** it; the instance will resume from the stopped state.
* The OS and all data on EBS volumes are intact.
* Public IP may **change** if not using an Elastic IP.

### Start using AWS Console

1. EC2 → Instances → Select stopped instance → **Instance State → Start Instance**

### Start using AWS CLI

```bash
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
```

## 3️⃣ Terminating an EC2 Instance ❌

### What happens when you terminate:

* Instance is **permanently deleted**.
* **EBS root volume** is usually deleted by default (unless “Delete on Termination” is unchecked).
* **Elastic IPs** and attached volumes must be manually released/deleted.
* Instance state changes to `shutting-down` → `terminated`.
* Cannot recover data unless you created a **snapshot or AMI** before termination.

### When to terminate:

* You **no longer need the instance** permanently.
* Want to **avoid all charges** for instance and attached resources.

### Terminate using AWS Console 🖱️

1. EC2 → Instances → Select instance → **Instance State → Terminate Instance**
2. Confirm the termination.

### Terminate using AWS CLI 🖥️

```bash
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
```

## 4️⃣ Difference Between Stop vs Terminate 🔄

| Feature   | Stop ⏸️                                    | Terminate ❌                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cost      | Stop paying for compute; still pay for EBS | No cost for instance; pay only for remaining EBS (if not deleted) |
| Data      | Root EBS volume preserved                  | Root EBS deleted (default)                                        |
| Public IP | Dynamic IP changes                         | Instance deleted permanently                                      |
| Recovery  | Start anytime                              | Cannot recover instance                                           |
| Use Case  | Temporary pause                            | Permanent deletion                                                |

## 5️⃣ Tips & Best Practices ✅

* Use **stop** for temporary pauses to save costs.
* Use **terminate** only if you **don’t need the instance or data**.
* Consider creating **AMIs or snapshots** before terminating, so you can restore later.
* Monitor **Free Tier limits** to avoid accidental charges.
* For production instances, consider **Elastic IPs** if you need a stable IP after stopping and starting.

## 6️⃣ Quick CLI Workflow 🖥️

```bash
# Stop an instance
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0

# Start the instance again
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0

# Terminate permanently
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
```

## 7️⃣ Analogy 🏠

* **Stop ⏸️** = Turning off the lights and locking the doors. You can come back later; everything inside remains intact.
* **Terminate ❌** = Demolishing the house. Everything inside is gone, and you cannot return.

---

✅ **Summary**

* **Stop** → Temporary pause, preserves data, saves compute cost.
* **Start** → Resume the stopped instance.
* **Terminate** → Permanent deletion, cannot recover data.
* Always **backup important data** before terminating.
