---

## 1️⃣ What is the Root User? 👑

* The **root user** is created automatically when you first sign up for an AWS account.
* It uses the **email + password** you registered with AWS.
* **Powers of root user**:

  * Full, unrestricted access to **all resources** in the account.
  * Can perform actions that **no IAM user/role can do**, like closing the AWS account, changing billing info, or modifying root MFA.

👉 Think of root as the **“master key”** to your entire AWS environment.

## 2️⃣ Why You Should Not Use Root User ❌

Using the root user for daily operations is dangerous:

* 🔓 **Unlimited Power** → No restrictions, so mistakes (like deleting production resources) can be catastrophic.
* 🕵️ **Security Risk** → If the root user credentials are compromised, attackers gain **total control** of your AWS account.
* 📉 **No Granularity** → Root user doesn’t follow the **principle of least privilege**. You can’t restrict its permissions.
* 🤯 **Accidental Misuse** → Even small human errors under root can lead to huge outages or data loss.

## 3️⃣ Best Practice: Use IAM Users & Groups 👥🔐

Instead of using root, you should:

### Step 1: Secure the Root User

* Enable **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** 🔑.
* Use the root account **only for account setup & critical tasks** (like billing).
* Store credentials securely (password manager / vault).

### Step 2: Create IAM Users

* Create an **IAM user** for each individual who needs access.
* Assign **programmatic access** or **console access** depending on their role.

### Step 3: Create IAM Groups

* Organize users into **groups** based on roles:

  * 👩‍💻 `Developers` → limited access to EC2/S3.
  * 🧑‍🔧 `Admins` → manage resources but not billing.
  * 👀 `Auditors` → read-only access.
* Attach **policies** to groups, not to users.

### Step 4: Add Users to Groups

* When a user joins, just add them to the right group — they inherit the correct permissions.
* This makes management scalable and consistent.

## 4️⃣ What Root User Should Be Used For ✅

Root account is only needed for a **few specific tasks**, like:

* 🧾 Managing **billing info & payment methods**.
* 🏦 Closing the AWS account.
* 🔄 Restoring IAM permissions when locked out.
* 🔑 Managing some AWS Organizations features.

**Everything else → use IAM roles/users**.

## 5️⃣ Analogy 🏠🔑

* Root user = **the master key to your house, bank, and car combined**.
* IAM users = **individual door keys** that only open what’s needed (kitchen, garage, office).
* Best practice = **lock the master key in a safe** 🔐 and use normal keys daily.

---

## ✅ Wrap-Up

* **Don’t use root user for daily work.**
* Root = full access, high risk.
* Instead →

  1. Secure root with MFA.
  2. Create IAM users.
  3. Organize them in groups.
  4. Attach policies to groups → users inherit permissions.

This ensures **security, least privilege, and easier management** ✅.
