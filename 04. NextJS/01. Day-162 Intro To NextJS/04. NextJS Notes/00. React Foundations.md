# 🚀 Getting Started with Next.js

To effectively learn **Next.js**, it helps to have a solid understanding of **JavaScript**, **React**, and general web development concepts. Since JavaScript and React are vast topics, you might wonder when you’re ready to start using Next.js.

Welcome to the **React Foundations** course! 🎉 This beginner-friendly, example-driven course guides you through the essential knowledge needed for Next.js. You’ll build a simple project step by step—starting with a plain JavaScript application, then migrating it to **React**, and finally to **Next.js**.

Each section builds on the previous one, so you can start at the point that matches your current knowledge. 🔗
