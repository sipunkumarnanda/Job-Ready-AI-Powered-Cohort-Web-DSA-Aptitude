
# 🌐 Routing in Next.js

Routing in **Next.js** means how users navigate between different pages of your application.
Unlike React (which often uses React Router), **Next.js has a built-in router** that is based on your project’s folder and file structure.

That means:
➡️ You don’t manually configure routes in a central file.
➡️ The structure of your `pages/` (old system) or `app/` (new system) folder **defines your routes**.

This is called **folder-based (or file-based) routing**.

# 📂 Folder-based Routing in Next.js

In Next.js, **every folder and file inside the `pages/` or `app/` directory becomes part of the URL path.**

---

## ✅ Example (Pages Router – `pages/` directory)

```
pages/
 ├── index.js
 ├── about.js
 ├── contact/
 │    └── index.js
 │    └── team.js
```

Generated routes:

* `/` → `pages/index.js`
* `/about` → `pages/about.js`
* `/contact` → `pages/contact/index.js`
* `/contact/team` → `pages/contact/team.js`

👉 Here, **folders create nested routes**, and files represent the last segment of the URL.

---

## ✅ Example (App Router – `app/` directory in Next.js 13+)

```
app/
 ├── page.js
 ├── about/
 │    └── page.js
 ├── blog/
 │    ├── page.js
 │    └── [id]/
 │         └── page.js
```

Generated routes:

* `/` → `app/page.js`
* `/about` → `app/about/page.js`
* `/blog` → `app/blog/page.js`
* `/blog/123` → `app/blog/[id]/page.js`

👉 In the App Router, **each folder can have its own `page.js` (or `layout.js`)**.
This allows **layouts, nested routes, and advanced features**.

# 🔑 Special Folder-based Features

1. **Dynamic Routes**

   * `[id].js` → `/blog/1`, `/blog/2`
   * Example: `app/blog/[id]/page.js`

2. **Nested Routes**

   * Subfolders represent nested URLs.
   * Example: `app/dashboard/settings/page.js` → `/dashboard/settings`

3. **Catch-all Routes**

   * `[...slug].js` → `/docs/a`, `/docs/a/b`
   * `[[...slug]].js` → `/docs` (optional)

4. **Layouts (App Router only)**

   * `layout.js` inside a folder defines a shared layout for all child pages.

---

✅ **In short:**

* Next.js uses **folder-based routing**.
* Each folder → represents a **path segment**.
* Each file → represents the **actual page**.
