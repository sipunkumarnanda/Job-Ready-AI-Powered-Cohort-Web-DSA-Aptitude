A **PWA (Progressive Web App)** is a **web application** that behaves like a **native mobile/desktop app**, but runs in the **browser**.

It combines the best of **web apps** (easy access via browser, no installation from app stores) and **native apps** (offline use, push notifications, installable).

## 🏗️ How PWAs Work

* **Service Worker** → A background script that handles caching, offline access, and push notifications.
* **Web App Manifest** → A JSON file that tells the browser how the app should appear (icon, theme color, splash screen).
* **HTTPS** → Required for security.
