## 📝 PWA Icon Generator — Quick Notes

**What it is:**
A web tool that helps you generate app icons + manifest entries for PWAs from a single image. You upload your base logo/image, configure a few settings, and the tool outputs multiple icon sizes + manifest file.

## ⚙️ Key Features

* Drag-and-drop interface to upload your base icon/image. ([pwa-icon-generator.vercel.app][1])
* Fields for **App Name**, **Short Name**, **Icon Prefix** (filename prefix) so that generated files have meaningful names. ([pwa-icon-generator.vercel.app][1])
* Ability to choose output formats: **PNG**, **JPEG**, **WebP**, **SVG**. ([pwa-icon-generator.vercel.app][1])
* Generates multiple icon sizes automatically (for various devices / OS launchers).
* Also generates a **manifest** file (web app manifest) with proper icon entries.

## ✅ Usage Steps

1. Upload or drag & drop your logo/image.
2. Input your app’s name („App Name“) — full name to show in install prompts.
3. Fill “Short Name” — used when space is constrained (e.g. on home screen).
4. Specify “Icon Prefix” — e.g. `icon-` so output filenames start like `icon-192.png`, etc.
5. Choose the desired image format(s).
6. Click “Generate Icons & Manifest” — tool generates a ZIP (or download bundle) with icons and manifest file.

## ⚠️ Benefits & Considerations

* **Benefits:**

  * Saves time: no need to manually make all icon sizes.
  * Ensures correct icon sizes for manifest, launchers.
  * Provides consistency: same source image used.

* **Considerations:**

  * Your base image should be high resolution / good quality so smaller icons still look sharp.
  * SVG output is helpful for scalable icons; but some platforms still expect PNG.
  * Make sure manifest settings align with your app (start\_url, display, theme\_color etc.) — this tool may only generate basic manifest metadata.
