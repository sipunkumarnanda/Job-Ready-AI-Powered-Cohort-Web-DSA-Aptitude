A **Splash Screen** is the **introductory screen** that appears when you open an app or website, usually shown for a few seconds before the main content loads.

It acts as a **branding and loading screen**, giving users a smooth first impression while the app prepares resources in the background.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features of a Splash Screen

1. **Brand Identity**

   * Usually shows the **logo, app name, or tagline**.
   * Helps reinforce branding and trust.

2. **Loading Feedback**

   * While the app fetches data, initializes services, or sets up the UI, the splash screen keeps users engaged.

3. **Seamless Transition**

   * Often includes simple animations (fade-in, zoom, progress bar) to make the transition to the main screen smooth.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works (Mobile vs Web)

### 1. **Mobile Apps (Android / iOS)**

* Defined in app configuration (e.g., `AndroidManifest.xml` in Android).
* Automatically shown while the app loads resources.
* Can be customized with **static images or animations**.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: In Android, you set a **theme with a splash drawable** that loads before `MainActivity`.

### 2. **Web Apps / PWA**

* Implemented via **Web App Manifest**.
* Controlled by properties like:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "My App",
    "short_name": "App",
    "start_url": "/",
    "background_color": "#ffffff",
    "theme_color": "#000000",
    "display": "standalone",
    "icons": [
      { "src": "/icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" }
    ]
  }
  ```
* When installed as a PWA, the browser automatically generates a **splash screen** based on this manifest.

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits of a Splash Screen

* âœ… Improves **first impression** with branding.
* âœ… Gives **visual feedback** while the app loads.
* âœ… Prevents user confusion (blank white screen).
* âœ… Smooth **transition into the main UI**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

* Keep it **short** (1â€“3 seconds).
* Show **brand/logo clearly**.
* Use **lightweight animations** if needed.
* Donâ€™t overload with text or ads.
* Ensure it transitions quickly to the main screen.

âœ… **Summary:**
A **splash screen** is a short, branded intro screen shown when an app or PWA starts. It enhances user experience by hiding loading delays and reinforcing the appâ€™s identity.
