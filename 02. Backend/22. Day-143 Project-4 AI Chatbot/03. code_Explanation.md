## 1. `ai.service.js` — AI Service Module

```js
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

    contents: prompt
  });

}

export default generateResponse;
```

```js
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import app from "./src/app.js";

dotenv.config();

const httpServer = createServer(app);

const io = new Server(httpServer, { /* options */ });

    console.log("A user disconnected");
  });

  socket.on("message", async (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });

  socket.on("ai-message", async (data) => {
    const response = await generateResponse(data.prompt);
    socket.emit("ai-message-response", { response });

# In-Depth Explanation

## A. `ai.service.js` — AI Response Generator Service

### Purpose:

* This module is responsible for interacting with the Google GenAI API.
* It exposes an asynchronous function that takes a prompt string and returns the AI-generated response.

### Key Points:

* **GoogleGenAI Client Initialization**:

  * `const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY });`
  * This sets up the AI client using your API key stored securely in environment variables (`.env`).

* **`generateResponse` function**:

  * Accepts a prompt string.
  * Calls `ai.models.generateContent` with model `"gemini-2.0-flash"` and the prompt.
  * Awaits the AI-generated content.
  * Returns the text from the response for usage elsewhere.

* **Environment Variables**:

  * `dotenv.config()` loads `.env` file to keep sensitive info like the API key outside your codebase.

---

## B. `server.js` — HTTP + Socket.IO Server

### Purpose:

* Sets up your backend server that:

  * Serves your Express app over HTTP.
  * Adds Socket.IO to handle real-time communication.
  * Connects AI service for generating responses to client prompts.

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. Imports and Configuration:

* `dotenv.config()` loads environment variables.
* `app` is your Express application (serves REST APIs, frontend, etc.).
* `createServer(app)` creates a Node.js HTTP server with your Express app.
* `Server` from `socket.io` creates a WebSocket server on top of HTTP.
* `generateResponse` is imported from AI service module.

---

#### 2. HTTP Server Setup:

```js
const httpServer = createServer(app);
```

* This HTTP server handles both HTTP requests and upgrades to WebSocket for Socket.IO.

---

#### 3. Socket.IO Server Initialization:

```js
const io = new Server(httpServer, { /* options */ });
```

* Creates Socket.IO server bound to HTTP server.
* Options can configure CORS, transports, etc. (none provided here).

---

#### 4. Listening for Client Connections:

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("A user connected");
  
  // ...
});
```

* Fired every time a client connects.
* Each client connection is represented by a unique `socket` object.
* This `socket` allows communication only with that specific client.

---

#### 5. Handling Client Disconnect:

```js
socket.on("disconnect", () => {
  console.log("A user disconnected");
});
```

* Listens for disconnection event (e.g., browser closed or lost connection).
* Useful for cleanup or logging.

---

#### 6. Listening to Custom `"message"` Event:

```js
socket.on("message", async (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

* Listens for a generic `"message"` event from the client.
* Logs the incoming data; can be extended for chat or commands.

---

#### 7. Handling AI Prompt Event `"ai-message"`:

```js
socket.on("ai-message", async (data) => {
  const response = await generateResponse(data.prompt);
  socket.emit("ai-message-response", { response });
});
```

* Listens for `"ai-message"` event carrying an object with a prompt (`data.prompt`).
* Calls the `generateResponse` function to get AI-generated text.
* Uses `socket.emit` to **send back the AI’s response to the same client** via `"ai-message-response"` event.

---

### Detailed Explanation of `socket.emit("ai-message-response", { response })`:

* **`socket.emit`** sends a named event (`"ai-message-response"`) to the **single client** represented by this socket.
* The payload is an object containing the AI-generated text (`response`).
* This is a **one-to-one communication**, ensuring only the requesting client gets the AI reply.
* On the client side, an event listener for `"ai-message-response"` should handle this and update the UI accordingly.

---

#### 8. Starting the Server:

```js
httpServer.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

* Begins listening on port 3000.
* Now clients can connect to this server for HTTP and WebSocket communication.

# How This All Works Together

1. **Client connects** → `"connection"` event fires → server logs connection.
2. Client sends an `"ai-message"` event with a prompt.
3. Server listens, calls AI service asynchronously.
4. When AI responds, server sends back `"ai-message-response"` event to that client only.
5. Client receives the AI response and displays or processes it.
6. If the client disconnects, the `"disconnect"` event fires and server logs it.
