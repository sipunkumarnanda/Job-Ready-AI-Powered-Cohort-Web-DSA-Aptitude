
# Types of Event in Socket.io

### 1️⃣ **Predefined / Built-in Events**

* These are events that Socket.IO provides out-of-the-box.
* They handle connection lifecycle, errors, and system-level events.
* Examples include:

| Event Name      | When It Fires                           | Description                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `connection`    | When a new client connects              | Fired on server when client connects |
| `disconnect`    | When a client disconnects               | Fired when client disconnects        |
| `connect_error` | When connection fails                   | Fired on connection errors           |
| `reconnect`     | When client reconnects after disconnect | Fired on successful reconnect        |

### 2️⃣ **Custom Events**

* These are events **defined by you**, with custom names.
* Used for exchanging application-specific data/messages.
* Examples:

```js
socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
  console.log('Received chat message:', msg);
});

socket.emit('new notification', { title: 'Hello!' });
```

* You name these events based on your app’s logic: `'message'`, `'typing'`, `'joinRoom'`, etc.
