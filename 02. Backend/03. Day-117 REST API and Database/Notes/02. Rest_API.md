
# 🗓️ Day - 3: REST APIs and HTTP Methods (Node.js with Express)

---

## 🌐 What is a REST API?

### ✅ REST (Representational State Transfer)
REST is a **design pattern** or **architecture style** used to build web services that communicate over HTTP.

- It provides a **standard structure** for client-server communication.
- REST APIs follow a **stateless** protocol — each request contains all the information needed (no session memory on the server).
- They use **HTTP methods** to define what type of action the client wants to perform on a resource.

### 🔄 Basic Example
Suppose you’re managing a blog. REST API endpoints could look like:

- `GET /posts` → Get all posts  
- `POST /posts` → Add a new post  
- `GET /posts/:id` → Get a single post  
- `PATCH /posts/:id` → Update part of a post  
- `DELETE /posts/:id` → Delete a post

## 🧾 HTTP Methods (CRUD Operations)

| Method     | Operation | Use Case                      | Analogy                        |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `GET`      | Read      | Fetch data                    | View a file                    |
| `POST`     | Create    | Add new data                  | Create a new file              |
| `PATCH`    | Update    | Modify existing data partially| Edit a line in the file        |
| `PUT`      | Replace   | Replace entire resource        | Replace the entire file        |
| `DELETE`   | Delete    | Remove data                   | Throw the file in the trash    |

> ✅ **POST, PUT, PATCH** usually send data using `req.body`.  
> ✅ **GET** and **DELETE** can include additional info via `req.params` or `req.query`.

## 📨 3 Main Ways to Send Data in REST APIs

### 1. `req.body` (BODY Parameters)
**Used in**: `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`  
**Where**: Hidden in the request payload (not in the URL)  
**Purpose**: To send sensitive, large, or structured data  

#### ✅ Example
```http
POST /register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "ankur",
  "password": "secret123"
}
````

```js
// Access in Express:
app.post('/register', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body.username); // 'ankur'
});
```

---

### 2. `req.query` (Query Parameters)

**Used in**: `GET`, sometimes `DELETE`
**Where**: After the `?` in the URL
**Purpose**: Filtering, searching, sorting (not sensitive)

#### ✅ Example

```http
GET /search?gender=male&age=24
```

```js
// Access in Express:
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.query.gender); // 'male'
  console.log(req.query.age);    // '24'
});
```

---

### 3. `req.params` (Route Parameters)

**Used in**: `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, etc.
**Where**: Embedded inside the route path
**Purpose**: Identifying specific resources (like user, ID)

#### ✅ Example

```http
GET /user/ankur_bit_io
```

```js
// Route setup:
app.get('/user/:username', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.params.username); // 'ankur_bit_io'
});
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts of REST

### 🔸 Resource

Anything meaningful like `user`, `post`, `product`.
Each resource has a unique endpoint:

```
GET /products
GET /products/:id
```

### 🔸 Stateless

Each HTTP request is **independent**; server doesn't store client state.

### 🔸 Uniform Interface

REST APIs should behave consistently with standardized methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)

## 🔄 Request-Response Lifecycle in Express

1. **Client sends a request**

   * Example: A browser hits `/products?category=shoes`

2. **Server receives the request**

   * Express matches it with a route handler like `app.get('/products', ...)`

3. **Request is processed**

   * Data is extracted from `req.query`, `req.body`, or `req.params`

4. **Server sends response**

   * Express uses `res.send()`, `res.json()`, etc. to send data

5. **Client receives the response**

   * Displayed in browser, postman, or handled by frontend app (React, etc.)

## 📦 Recap: Choosing Between Body, Params, and Query

| Type         | Usage                | When to Use                        |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `req.body`   | POST / PATCH / PUT   | Submit forms, send login/post data |
| `req.params` | GET / PATCH / DELETE | Identify a specific resource       |
| `req.query`  | GET                  | Filtering, searching, sorting      |

## 💡 Real-World Example: Social Media API

| Action                | Route                         | Data Location              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| View a user's profile | `GET /user/:username`         | `req.params.username`      |
| Filter posts          | `GET /posts?tag=tech&limit=5` | `req.query`                |
| Create new post       | `POST /posts`                 | `req.body`                 |
| Update a post caption | `PATCH /posts/:id`            | `req.params.id + req.body` |
| Delete a comment      | `DELETE /comments/:commentId` | `req.params.commentId`     |

## ✅ Summary

* REST is a **rulebook** for building scalable APIs.
* Use **HTTP methods** to define the action.
* Data can be sent through:

  * `req.body`: hidden, secure
  * `req.params`: specific resource
  * `req.query`: optional filters
* Express makes creating REST APIs easy and powerful.
