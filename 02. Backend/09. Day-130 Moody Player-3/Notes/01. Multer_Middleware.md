
## üì¶ Multer in Node.js ‚Äî Complete Notes

### üß© 1. **What is Multer?**

`Multer` is a middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is **primarily used for uploading files** in Node.js applications built with **Express**.

* It processes incoming form-data containing files before it reaches your route handlers.
* Stores the files either in memory or on disk.

---

### ‚ùì 2. **Why do we need Multer?**

#### üí° The problem *before* Multer:

* Express (or `body-parser`) can handle JSON and URL-encoded form data, but **not `multipart/form-data`**, which is the content type used when uploading files via forms.
* If you try to upload a file without `multer`, `req.body` and `req.file` will be **empty or undefined**, because Express **can‚Äôt parse binary file data** on its own.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **How does Multer solve the problem?**

Multer:

* Intercepts requests of type `multipart/form-data`
* Parses out text fields (like `title`, `artist`) into `req.body`
* Extracts the file(s) and stores them either:

  * In memory (buffer) ‚Äî temporary
  * On disk (as a file) ‚Äî persistent
* Adds file info to `req.file` (for single file) or `req.files` (for multiple files)

This makes file handling clean and efficient.

### üîß 4. **How to Use Multer ‚Äî Step by Step**

#### üìå Step 1: Install Multer

```bash
npm install multer
```

---

#### üìå Step 2: Import and Configure in Your Route File

```js
import multer from 'multer';

// Memory storage (file is kept in buffer for further processing)
const upload = multer({ storage: multer.memoryStorage() });

// Or disk storage
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, 'uploads/'); // folder to save file
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname);
  }
});
const uploadDisk = multer({ storage: storage });
```

---

#### üìå Step 3: Use as Middleware in Routes

```js
// For single file upload (field name should match form key)
router.post('/upload', upload.single('audio'), (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body);   // other form fields
    console.log(req.file);   // file info
    res.send('File uploaded successfully');
});
```

* `upload.single('audio')`: Handles one file upload
* `upload.array('photos', 10)`: Handles up to 10 files (field name = `photos`)
* `upload.fields([{ name: 'avatar' }, { name: 'resume' }])`: Handles multiple named fields

### üóÇÔ∏è 5. **What is Stored in `req.file` or `req.files`?**

For `upload.single('audio')`:

```js
req.file = {
  fieldname: 'audio',
  originalname: 'song.mp3',
  encoding: '7bit',
  mimetype: 'audio/mpeg',
  buffer: <Buffer>,         // if using memoryStorage
  size: 2342342             // size in bytes
}
```

For `upload.array()`, it‚Äôs stored in `req.files` as an array of such objects.

---

### üîê 6. **Common Use Cases**

* Uploading user profile pictures
* Uploading audio/video files
* Uploading PDFs, documents, etc.
* Uploading to cloud storage like AWS S3 (via buffer from `memoryStorage`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 7. **Best Practices & Tips**

| Tip                                | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ‚úÖ Validate file types              | Use `fileFilter` to restrict MIME types                            |
| ‚úÖ Limit file size                  | Use `limits` option to prevent large uploads                       |
| ‚úÖ Sanitize file names              | Avoid security risks                                               |
| ‚úÖ Use memoryStorage for cloud      | Buffer makes it easy to upload to services like AWS S3 or Firebase |
| ‚ùå Don‚Äôt keep large files in memory | Can crash the server ‚Äî use disk or stream to cloud                 |

### üîÑ 8. **Example: Full Route Using Multer**

```js
import express from "express";
import multer from "multer";

const router = express.Router();
const upload = multer({ storage: multer.memoryStorage() });

router.post('/songs', upload.single('audio'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { title, artist } = req.body;
    const file = req.file;

    if (!file) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'No file uploaded' });
    }

    // Call your service to upload file (e.g. to S3)
    const fileUrl = await uploadFileToS3(file);

    res.status(201).json({
      message: 'Song uploaded',
      data: { title, artist, fileUrl }
    });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Upload failed' });
  }
});
```

Let me know if you want to integrate `multer` with AWS S3, Firebase, or do file validation (e.g. allow only `.mp3`).


---


### üìå `upload.single('audio')` **must match** the name of the field used in the incoming form data.

---

### üß† Explanation

```js
upload.single('audio')
```

* This tells `multer`: "Look for a **single file** uploaded with the **form field name** `'audio'`"
* If the field name doesn't match, `multer` will **not process the file**, and `req.file` will be `undefined`

---

### üí° Example: Matching Field Name

#### ‚úÖ Backend:

```js
router.post('/songs', upload.single('audio'), (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.file);  // contains uploaded file info
});
```

#### ‚úÖ Frontend / Postman / Form:

| Field Type | Field Name | Example Value       |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| File       | `audio`    | `mySong.mp3` (file) |
| Text       | `title`    | "My Song"           |
| Text       | `artist`   | "My Artist"         |

---

### ‚ùå If the frontend sends a file with a field name like `'songFile'`, but backend expects `'audio'`:

```js
upload.single('audio')  // ‚Üê expects field name 'audio'
```

* The file will not be processed.
* `req.file` will be `undefined`.

---

### ‚úÖ Always Ensure:

* The argument to `upload.single('...')` matches the **exact field name** in your frontend form, Postman body, or fetch/axios call.
