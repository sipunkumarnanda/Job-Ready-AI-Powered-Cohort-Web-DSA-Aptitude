
## 🔐 Understanding `bcrypt`, `argon2`, and `scrypt` – Password Hashing Algorithms

---

### ✅ **What’s Common Between Them?**

All three (`bcrypt`, `argon2`, `scrypt`) are **cryptographic password hashing algorithms** used to store passwords **securely** by making them hard to crack, even if attackers get access to your database.

---

## 1. 🔐 `bcrypt` (Most Common)

### 📌 **Overview:**

* Developed in 1999.
* Based on the **Blowfish** cipher.
* Very widely adopted in web applications.

### ✅ **Strengths:**

* **Slow by design** → makes brute-force attacks expensive.
* Automatically handles **salting**.
* Available in almost all languages (`bcrypt` in Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
* Secure **if used with proper parameters** (e.g., saltRounds = 10–12).

### ❌ **Weaknesses:**

* No protection against **side-channel attacks**.
* No built-in memory hardness → easier for GPU attacks than Argon2 or scrypt.

### 💡 Node.js Example:

```js
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

const hash = await bcrypt.hash('mypassword', 10);
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare('mypassword', hash);
```

## 2. 🛡️ `argon2` (Modern & Strongest)

### 📌 **Overview:**

* Winner of the **Password Hashing Competition (PHC)** in 2015.
* Designed to replace both bcrypt and scrypt as the most secure option.

### ✅ **Strengths:**

* **Memory-hard** → very effective against GPU & ASIC attacks.
* Two modes:

  * `argon2i`: Resistant to side-channel attacks
  * `argon2d`: Resistant to GPU attacks
  * `argon2id`: Hybrid (recommended for most apps)
* Highly configurable (time, memory, parallelism)

### ❌ **Weaknesses:**

* **Less supported** than bcrypt (but growing fast).
* Might require **native bindings** or libraries in some languages.

### 💡 Node.js Example (using `argon2` package):

```bash
npm install argon2
```

```js
import argon2 from 'argon2';

const hash = await argon2.hash('mypassword');
const isMatch = await argon2.verify(hash, 'mypassword');
```

## 3. 🧠 `scrypt` (Memory-Hard)

### 📌 **Overview:**

* Developed in 2009 by Colin Percival.
* Designed to make brute-force password cracking **expensive in both time and memory**.

### ✅ **Strengths:**

* **Memory-hard** like Argon2.
* Slows down attacks using GPUs or ASICs.
* Better than bcrypt when used correctly.

### ❌ **Weaknesses:**

* Can be tricky to configure securely.
* Slightly slower than bcrypt.
* Not as modern or flexible as Argon2.

### 💡 Node.js Example (using built-in `crypto` module):

```js
import { scrypt, randomBytes } from 'crypto';
import { promisify } from 'util';

const scryptAsync = promisify(scrypt);

const salt = randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
const derivedKey = await scryptAsync('mypassword', salt, 64);
console.log(derivedKey.toString('hex'));
```
