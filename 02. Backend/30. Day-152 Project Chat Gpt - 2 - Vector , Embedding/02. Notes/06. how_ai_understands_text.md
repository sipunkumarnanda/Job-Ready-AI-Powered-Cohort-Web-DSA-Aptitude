---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ You Type Text** ‚å®Ô∏è

* Input: `"hello AI"`
* This is **plain text**‚Äîjust characters stored on your device.
* At this point, the AI cannot understand meaning; it only sees a **sequence of tokens (words or subwords)**.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Tokenization** üî°

**Question:** What happens first inside the AI?

**Explanation:**

* The model splits text into **tokens**. Tokens can be words, subwords, or characters depending on the model.

* Example (simplified): `"hello AI"` ‚Üí `["hello", "AI"]` or `["he", "llo", "A", "I"]`

* Each token is then mapped to an **integer ID** using the model‚Äôs **vocabulary**:

  ```
  ["hello", "AI"] ‚Üí [15496, 8932]
  ```

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Conversion to Embeddings** üßÆ

**Question:** Does AI understand numbers or text?

**Explanation:**

* AI models **do not understand plain text directly**. They only understand **vectors (embeddings)**.
* Each token ID is mapped to a **high-dimensional vector**:

  ```
  15496 ‚Üí [0.21, -0.13, 0.44, ...]  (say, 768 dimensions)
  8932  ‚Üí [0.05, 0.33, -0.11, ...]
  ```
* These embeddings capture **semantic meaning** of tokens in vector space.

‚úÖ **Key Insight:** The AI now works with **numbers, not characters**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Passing Through the Model** ‚ö°

**Question:** How does AI generate a response from vectors?

**Explanation:**

1. **Input embeddings** are fed into the **neural network layers** (like transformers).
2. **Attention Mechanism:** Each token vector attends to other token vectors to understand **context**.

   * For `"hello AI"`, the model recognizes `"AI"` as related to **artificial intelligence** and `"hello"` as a greeting.
3. **Hidden layers process information:**

   * Each layer transforms embeddings into new embeddings that represent **contextual meaning**.
4. **Output logits:**

   * The model predicts the **next token probabilities**. For example:

     ```
     Probability("!" | "hello AI") = 0.45
     Probability("How") = 0.20
     Probability("there") = 0.15
     ```
5. **Sampling/Decoding:**

   * The model chooses tokens based on probabilities (greedy, beam search, or sampling).

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Converting Tokens Back to Text** üìù

* Chosen token IDs are mapped back to text:

  ```
  [15496, 2003, 345] ‚Üí "Hello! How are you?"
  ```
* This becomes the **AI‚Äôs response in plain text**.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Sending Response to Your Screen** üñ•Ô∏è

* The AI sends the text back to your application or browser.
* The frontend displays it as:

  ```
  Hello! How are you?
  ```
