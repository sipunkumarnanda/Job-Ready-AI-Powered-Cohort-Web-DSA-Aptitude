# 📌 Vectors, Vector Embeddings & Vector Databases

Have you ever wondered how **Netflix recommends movies**, **Amazon suggests products**, or **YouTube shows search results**? 🤔 How do these platforms know what we might like next? Let’s dive deep into the world of **vectors, embeddings, and vector databases** to understand this.

## 1️⃣ Understanding the Problem: Product Recommendation System

Imagine you’re building an **Amazon product recommendation system**.

* Example: You buy **protein powder** 🥤.
* Amazon then suggests other related items like **BCAA**, **Creatine**, or a **Shaker**.

The question arises: **How does the system automatically figure out what to recommend?**

---

### 🔹 Brute-Force Approach: Manual Arrays

The simplest way to solve this problem is by creating arrays of similar items:

```text
[Protein, BCAA, Creatine, Shaker, Yoga Mat]
[Fruits: Apple, Orange, Banana, Mango, Watermelon]
[Vegetables: Tomato, Potato, Eggplant]
[Clothes: Shirt, Shoes, Belt, Socks]
[Electronics: Camera, Microphone, Tripod, Ring Light, Earphones]
```

**How it works:**

* If a user buys **Protein**, the system recommends **BCAA, Creatine, Shaker, Yoga Mat**.
* If a user adds **Shirt**, it recommends all other items in the clothes array.

✅ **Pros:** Simple and intuitive.

❌ **Cons / Limitations:**

1. **Manual Insertion**: Every new product must be manually added to the right array.
2. **Not Scalable**: Amazon has **millions of products**, thousands of new products added daily. Manually updating arrays is impossible.
3. **Cannot discover new relationships automatically**:

   * Users might buy **Protein + Banana** or **Protein + Blender**, but the system won’t know unless manually added.
4. **Rigid boundaries**:

   * Items like “Orange” could refer to a fruit 🍊 or a color 🎨. A manual array cannot differentiate context.
5. **Multiple associations**:

   * Some items belong to multiple categories (e.g., a Shaker could belong with protein supplements **and** kitchen appliances).

---

### 🧩 Real-World Example: Hidden Patterns

In the USA, Walmart discovered that **diapers and beer** are often bought together on Fridays. 🍼🍺

* At first glance, it seems random.
* Investigation showed: corporate employees with newborns buy diapers for the baby and beer for themselves for the weekend.

**Insight:** Hidden relationships exist that humans cannot manually predefine.

* The brute-force array approach **cannot capture these hidden patterns**.
* Therefore, we need a more **dynamic, scalable solution**.

---

## 2️⃣ Graph-Based Recommendation System

Instead of arrays, consider a **graph-based approach**:

* Every **product is a node**: Protein, Creatine, Potato, Tomato, Onion, Shaker, etc.
* Products are **connected with edges** that represent relationships.
* Each edge has a **weight**, representing how often the products are bought together.

**Example:**

* You buy **Protein** 🥤 and **BCAA** 💊.
* The edge weight between Protein ↔ BCAA increases by 1.
* Another user buys Protein + Creatine; the edge weight Protein ↔ Creatine increases by 1.
* Over time, the system **learns automatically** which products are most frequently bought together.

---

### 🔹 How Recommendations Work with Graphs

1. Track every combination bought by users.
2. Increment edge weights for each combination.
3. Recommend products **with the highest edge weight** when a user buys something.

✅ **Advantages:**

* Automatic learning from user behavior.
* Can handle multiple combinations of products at once.
* Dynamic and scalable.
* Can discover **hidden patterns**, like “diapers and beer.”

# 📌 Incremental Weight System: How It Works

In the previous approach, we tried to implement a **graph/2D array-based recommendation system**. Here’s a quick recap of how it works:

1. Every product combination purchased increases the **weight** of that pair:

   * Example:

     * **Protein + BCAA** → weight += 1
     * **Protein + Shaker** → weight += 1
     * **BCAA + Shaker** → weight += 1

2. All these weights are stored in a **2D array**:

|          | Protein | BCAA | Creatine | Shaker | Mic |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | -------- | ------ | --- |
| Protein  | 0       | 50   | 40       | 4      | 1   |
| BCAA     | 50      | 0    | 35       | 3      | 3   |
| Creatine | 40      | 35   | 0        | 1      | 0   |
| Shaker   | 4       | 3    | 1        | 0      | 0   |
| Mic      | 1       | 3    | 0        | 0      | 0   |

✅ **How recommendations work**:

* Sort the row of the product purchased by **weight**.
* Recommend products with **highest weights first**.
* Ignore zeros (no one bought that combination).

📌 **Example:**

* If a user buys **Creatine**, the system looks at the row for Creatine: 40, 35, 0, 1, 0 → Recommend Protein (40), BCAA (35), Shaker (1).

---

# ⚠️ Limitations of 2D Array Approach

Although the above method works, there are serious issues:

### 1️⃣ Space Complexity 💾

* For **1 million products**, the array size would be **1 million × 1 million** → 1 trillion entries!
* Impossible to store in memory efficiently.

### 2️⃣ Insertion Problem ✏️

* New product comes in, e.g., **Orange Protein**.
* Need to add a **new row and column** to the 2D array.
* Updating the array every time a new product is listed is **time-consuming** and **not scalable**.

### 3️⃣ Sorting Time ⏱️

* Each time a user buys a product, you must **sort the row** to find the top recommendations.
* For large arrays, sorting takes **O(n log n)** → slow for millions of products.

### 4️⃣ Cold Start Problem ❄️

* New products have **no weight yet**.
* System cannot recommend them until enough users buy them.
* E.g., a brand-new protein powder → cannot automatically recommend BCAA or Creatine because no combination exists yet.

### 5️⃣ Semantic Meaning Limitation 🧠

* The system **only captures co-occurrence**, not semantic similarity.
* Example: **“On Protein” vs “My Protein”** → both are proteins, but if one is new, no recommendations will appear.
* Cannot automatically infer that **similar products belong to the same category**.

### 6️⃣ Boundary & Range Issues 🔢

* If products are mapped to **numbers** (e.g., Watermelon = 4, Mango = 5), recommendation is based on **adjacent numbers**.
* Problem:

  * Nearby numbers may **not be related**.
  * Example: Coffee (200) is far from Protein (101).
  * If you try recommending based on range, unrelated products like fruits might show up → incorrect recommendation.

### 7️⃣ Single Meaning Problem ❗

* Each product can have multiple meanings or categories.
* Example: Orange → Fruit 🍊 or Color 🎨.
* Number assignment cannot differentiate context → leads to wrong recommendations.

# 💡 Summary: Why This Approach Fails

| Problem        | Explanation                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Space          | 2D array size grows quadratically (n × n)              |
| Insertion      | New products require adding rows & columns manually    |
| Sorting        | Sorting large arrays every time is slow                |
| Cold Start     | Cannot recommend new products automatically            |
| Semantic       | Fails to understand “similar meaning” products         |
| Boundary       | Number adjacency may lead to unrelated recommendations |
| Single Meaning | Cannot differentiate multi-category products           |

✅ **Takeaway:**

* The 2D array + incremental weight system works for **small datasets**, but **fails at scale**.
* It also cannot solve **cold start** or **semantic similarity** problems.

# 📌 Problem with One Dimension

* "We can’t solve this with one dimension. I’ve put it on the X-axis. I’m just finding the range, looking at the distance to see who is close to whom."
* Meaning, just placing things on a single line and trying to find relationships is very limited.

**Example:**

* Protein is not just related to BCAA.
* Protein making, eating banana, using a blender, coffee, tea – all have different relationships.
* You can’t represent all these relationships in one dimension.

✅ **Conclusion:**

* One dimension is too limited. We need to think multi-featured / multi-dimensional.

# 🎬 Netflix Movie Example

* A user watched the movie “Dhamaal.”

* “Dhamaal” is a comedy → we recommend another comedy movie next.

* If they also watched “Hera Pheri,” the next could be “Golmaal.”

* Similarly, if a user watches English Sci-Fi, we recommend another Sci-Fi movie.

* Suppose there are 20 movies in Netflix and a user watched one. How do we recommend the next movie?

**Step 1:** Determine the type of movie the user watched.

* Is it comedy, serious, action, or peaceful?

---

# 📊 Plotting Movies on a Graph

* We can use a graph to represent movies based on features.

* Example: X-axis = Action level (-10 to 10)

  * +10 → full action
  * -10 → peaceful / no action

* Y-axis = Comedy level (-10 to 10)

  * +10 → very comedic
  * -10 → very serious

* Now we have a 2D array (Action vs Comedy).

**Example placements:**

* “3 Idiots” → high comedy, somewhat peaceful → placed accordingly
* “Kahani” → serious and peaceful → placed lower-left
* “War” → full action → top-right
* “Dangal” → serious but some action → somewhere middle-left

**Benefit:**

* When a user watches a movie, we can recommend movies near that point on the graph.
* “3 Idiots” → recommend “Golmaal,” “Hera Pheri,” “Barfi,” “Queen” (movies close in comedy-peaceful space).
* “Kahani” → recommend movies like “Swades,” “Lagaan,” “Dangal.”

---

# 🎯 Concept of Vectors

* Each movie can be represented as a vector:

  * “War” → Action = 10, Comedy = -5
  * This vector represents its position in 2D space.
* Vectors can be in higher dimensions too: 5D, 10D, or even hundreds of dimensions.

**5D Example:**

* 1st dimension → Action

* 2nd → Comedy

* 3rd → Emotional drama

* 4th → Romance

* 5th → Realism

* “War” → \[Action=10, Comedy=-5, Emotional=-4, Romance=2, Realism=-7]

✅ **Key Idea:**

* We can now compare movies in multiple dimensions and recommend the closest ones.
* Even if we can’t visualize 5D, we can calculate distances numerically.
* This is exactly what vectors are: numbers representing the position of an item in N-dimensional space.

---

# 🧠 Neural Network Automation

* How do we assign numbers to each dimension?
* We don’t have to manually assign -10 to 10.
* A neural network can take a movie as input and output its vector in N-dimensional space.
* We don’t need to know what each dimension “means.” The network figures it out automatically.

**Real-world example:**

* Llama or other embeddings → 496 dimensions
* Each dimension captures hidden properties of the movie.
* We use these vectors to find closest movies for recommendations.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* One dimension is too simple.
* Start with 2D (Action vs Comedy) to visualize, then expand to 5D, 10D, or even 496D.
* Each movie becomes a vector in N-dimensional space.
* Recommend movies based on vector proximity.

# 🌟 Future Recommendations Using Vectors

* Later, if I want to recommend anything, I can recommend the elements that are **close to the target element** in the vector space.

* Example: For **protein**, I compute its vector and insert it into the vector space. Now, when I look for nearby elements:

  * BCAA will be nearby
  * Creatine will also be nearby
  * Even a blender could appear nearby in the multi-dimensional array

* Previously, we were checking only in **one dimension** (X-axis), but in multi-dimensional space, items like blender and coffee could also appear close.

---

# 🧩 Famous Vector Analogy: King – Man + Woman = Queen

* This is a classic example of vector embeddings. What does it mean?

* The vector space **places similar things near each other** to enable recommendations.

* Example: If someone watched “War,” nearby vectors could recommend “Pathaan.”

* For King and Man:

  * Similarity factors: Both are humans, both male, both have beards.
  * Differences: Power, royalty, wealth

* Represented in a multi-dimensional array:

  * Each dimension corresponds to a factor (human, male, wealthy, power, royalty, etc.)

* King vector minus Man vector → removes common factors (both human, both male)

* Add Woman vector → result = Queen vector

* Why? Differences (power, royalty, money) remain in Queen vector.

✅ **Key Idea:**

* Vectors let us **compare multiple features simultaneously**, not just one.
* This is what **vector embeddings** are: numeric representations of items in multi-dimensional space capturing semantic meaning.

# 📏 Measuring Closeness Between Vectors

Two main methods:

1. **Euclidean Distance**

   * Measures straight-line distance between two points
   * Formula:

     $$
     \text{distance} = \sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2 + \dots + (a_n - b_n)^2}
     $$

2. **Cosine Distance / Similarity**

   * Measures **angle between vectors**
   * Focuses on **direction, not magnitude**
   * Formula:

     $$
     \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\|}
     $$
   * Values:

     * 1 → same direction (high similarity)
     * 0 → orthogonal
     * -1 → opposite direction (completely dissimilar)

✅ **LLMs and recommendation systems prefer cosine similarity** because it captures **semantic similarity**, not literal distance.

# 📺 YouTube Example

* Videos are embedded into vector space: Tech content, Comedy content, News content, Prank content, etc.

* User searches: “What is an array?”

  * Input is converted to a vector
  * The search retrieves content vectors **close in semantic meaning**
  * Even if the exact word is not present, semantically similar videos appear

* Example: “System Design” search → returns videos about “System Design Roadmap,” “System Design Tutorials,” etc.

  * This is because each video is represented as a vector in multi-dimensional space
  * YouTube finds vectors **closest to the query vector**

---

# 💾 Vector Database

* All vectors are stored in a **vector database**
* Purpose: Efficiently retrieve vectors **closest to a given query vector**
* Next lecture will cover:

  * Why vectors are stored in vector DBs instead of SQL/NoSQL
  * Internal workings of vector search

---

✅ **Summary:**

1. Vector embeddings allow multi-dimensional representation of items.
2. Similar items are placed close together in vector space.
3. Recommendations use **cosine similarity** to find semantically close items.
4. Vector databases store these embeddings efficiently for fast retrieval.
5. LLMs, YouTube, and recommendation systems all use this principle.
