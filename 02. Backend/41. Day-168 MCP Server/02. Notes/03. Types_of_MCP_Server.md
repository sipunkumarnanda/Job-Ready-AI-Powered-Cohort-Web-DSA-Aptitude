
# ⚡ Types of MCP Servers

---

## 1️⃣ STDIO Servers 🖥️

**What it is:**

* The **default / most common transport** for MCP.
* The server runs as a **child process** of the client.
* Communication happens over **standard input (stdin)** and **standard output (stdout)** using **JSON-RPC messages**.

**How it works:**

* Client spawns the server → establishes connection via stdin/stdout.
* JSON-RPC requests/responses are exchanged.

**Advantages:**
✅ Simple, fast, secure (local-only).
✅ Works offline (no internet required).
✅ Great for tools bundled with the AI app.

**Limitations:**
❌ Server and client must run on the **same machine**.
❌ Not suitable for distributed/remote servers.

**Use case example:**

* Claude Desktop or ChatGPT Agent runs an MCP stdio server that provides **local file access**.

## 2️⃣ Streamable HTTP Servers 🌍

**What it is:**

* MCP servers that communicate via **HTTP**.
* Support **streaming responses**, so clients can start consuming partial results before the full response is ready.

**How it works:**

* Client sends JSON-RPC request over HTTP POST.
* Server responds with streamed JSON chunks.
* Useful for **long-running or large-output tasks**.

**Advantages:**
✅ Can run **remotely** (cloud services).
✅ Handles **large or streaming responses** (e.g., logs, DB queries).
✅ Fits well with modern web infrastructure (reverse proxies, auth).

**Limitations:**
❌ Needs network access.
❌ More complex than stdio (requires proper server hosting).

**Use case example:**

* A weather MCP server hosted on the cloud, streaming **live weather updates** to an AI assistant.

## 3️⃣ Testing & Debugging Servers 🧪🐞

**What it is:**

* Special-purpose MCP servers designed for **development, testing, and debugging**.
* Often include **mock tools/resources** to simulate real environments.

**How it works:**

* Developers run a test server locally.
* It returns **predictable responses** (instead of hitting real APIs).
* Can log JSON-RPC requests/responses for inspection.

**Advantages:**
✅ Faster development (no real API calls needed).
✅ Safer for testing without affecting production systems.
✅ Helps validate **MCP client behavior**.

**Limitations:**
❌ Not meant for production.
❌ Limited to dev/test use cases.

**Use case example:**

* A developer builds a GitHub MCP server and first tests it with a **mock debugging MCP server** before pointing it to the real GitHub API.

## 4️⃣ SSE (Server-Sent Events) Servers 📡

**What it is:**

* MCP servers that use **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** over HTTP.
* SSE provides a **one-way stream** from server → client.

**How it works:**

* Client subscribes to a resource/tool.
* Server continuously pushes events/messages (as text/event-stream).
* Good for **real-time notifications** or **push updates**.

**Advantages:**
✅ Great for **event-driven updates** (e.g., stock tickers, file changes).
✅ Efficient: only server pushes data when needed.
✅ Simpler than WebSockets for one-way streaming.

**Limitations:**
❌ One-direction only (server → client).
❌ Not ideal for interactive two-way RPC calls.

**Use case example:**

* An MCP server streaming **live stock price updates** to an AI trading assistant.
* An **enterprise log server** pushing real-time alerts into an AI chatbot.

# 🗣️ Interview-Ready Line

> “MCP supports multiple server types depending on the transport and use case: **STDIO** for local, secure, fast connections; **Streamable HTTP** for remote scalable integrations; **Testing/Debugging servers** for safe development; and **SSE servers** for real-time push-based updates. Together, these give developers flexibility to connect AI apps to virtually any environment.”
