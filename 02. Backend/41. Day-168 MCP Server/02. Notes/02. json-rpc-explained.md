
# 📜 What is JSON-RPC?

**JSON-RPC** = **JSON Remote Procedure Call**

* It’s a **lightweight protocol** that lets programs talk to each other using **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**.
* It defines how a client can call a **method** (like a function) on a server, pass **parameters**, and get back a **result** — all encoded in JSON.

👉 Think of it as a **messaging format for APIs**:

* **Client**: “Hey server, run `add(2,3)` for me.”
* **Server**: “Sure, the result is `5`.”

# 🔑 Key Features of JSON-RPC

* **Lightweight** → Uses JSON, very small overhead.
* **Transport-agnostic** → Can work over HTTP, WebSocket, TCP, STDIO, etc.
* **Bidirectional** → Both client and server can send requests.
* **Standardized structure** → Each message has a defined format.

# 🏗️ Structure of a JSON-RPC Message

### 1. **Request** (client → server)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "add",
  "params": [2, 3],
  "id": 1
}
```

* `jsonrpc`: Always `"2.0"` (the version).
* `method`: The function to call (`"add"`).
* `params`: Arguments (`2` and `3`).
* `id`: A unique ID to match response with request.

---

### 2. **Response** (server → client)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 5,
  "id": 1
}
```

* `result`: The returned value (here: `5`).
* `id`: Matches the request’s ID.

---

### 3. **Error Response**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Method not found"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

* `error`: Contains error code & message if something went wrong.

# ⚡ Example Workflow

1. Client: `"method": "multiply", "params": [4, 6]`
2. Server: `"result": 24`

That’s it! No fancy schemas, just **JSON messages** back and forth.

# 📡 Where is JSON-RPC Used?

* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** → MCP builds on JSON-RPC for all its communication.
* **Cryptocurrency APIs** (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum clients).
* **Remote debugging tools** (e.g., browser dev tools protocol).
* **Custom internal APIs** where lightweight communication is needed.

# 🗣️ Interview-Ready Explanation

> “JSON-RPC is a lightweight, stateless protocol that uses JSON to perform remote procedure calls. A client sends a request with a method name and parameters, and the server replies with either a result or an error. It’s transport-agnostic, so it can run over HTTP, WebSockets, or even stdio. MCP uses JSON-RPC as its foundation because it’s simple, standardized, and easy to integrate.”

# 🎯 Quick Summary

* JSON-RPC = JSON-based **Remote Procedure Call protocol**.
* Uses **requests, responses, errors** in JSON format.
* **Transport-independent** (works anywhere).
* Widely used in **MCP, blockchain, debugging, and APIs**.
