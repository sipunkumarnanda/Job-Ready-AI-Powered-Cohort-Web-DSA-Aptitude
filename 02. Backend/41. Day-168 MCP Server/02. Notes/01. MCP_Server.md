
# 🌐 What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP (**Model Context Protocol**) is an **open-source standard** for connecting **AI applications** (like Claude or ChatGPT) to **external systems** in a safe and consistent way.

* 📂 **Data sources** → local files, databases, APIs
* 🛠️ **Tools** → search engines, calculators, GitHub actions
* 🧾 **Workflows/Prompts** → specialized instructions or templates

👉 **Analogy:**
MCP is like **USB-C for AI** 🔌.
Just as USB-C provides a universal way to plug devices together, MCP provides a universal way for AI applications to connect to data and tools.

# 🚀 What can MCP enable?

Here’s what becomes possible once an AI app speaks MCP:

* 📅 **Personal Assistants** → Agents can access Google Calendar + Notion → schedule tasks & summarize notes.
* 💻 **Developer Tools** → Claude Code can generate a **web app** directly from a **Figma design**.
* 🏢 **Enterprise AI** → Chatbots can query multiple internal databases → employees can analyze org-wide data via natural language.
* 🎨 **Creative AI** → AI models can create 3D designs in Blender and **send them to a 3D printer**.

👉 **Key idea:** MCP makes AI not just “smart text generators” but **action-taking agents** connected to real-world systems.

# 🧩 Core Components of MCP

### 1. **Client (AI Host)** 💻

* The AI app or agent (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude Desktop).
* It connects to MCP servers and **uses their capabilities**.

### 2. **Server** 🗄️

* Provides **capabilities** like data, tools, and workflows.
* Example: a GitHub MCP server exposing “create branch” or “list PRs”.

### 3. **Resources** 📄

* Read-only data sources (files, DB rows, API responses).
* Example: `GET /user/profile`.

### 4. **Tools** 🛠️

* Functions an AI can **call safely**.
* Example: `sendEmail(to, subject, body)`.

### 5. **Prompts** 📝

* Predefined templates to guide AI.
* Example: “bug report template” prompt.

# 🔗 How MCP Works (Lifecycle)

MCP is built on **JSON-RPC 2.0** (lightweight request/response protocol).

1. **Initialize**

   * Client → Server: “Here’s my version & capabilities.”
   * Server → Client: “Here are my tools/resources.”

2. **Operation**

   * Client requests: “Run tool X with arguments.”
   * Server responds with structured JSON output.

3. **Shutdown**

   * Either side can close the session safely.

👉 **Initialization Example:**

```json
// Client -> Server
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {"sampling": {}},
    "clientInfo": {"name": "DemoClient"}
  }
}

// Server -> Client
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {"tools": {"listChanged": true}},
    "serverInfo": {"name": "DemoServer"}
  }
}
```

# 🧑‍💻 Example: Minimal MCP Server (JavaScript)

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/stdio";

// Create a new MCP server
const server = new Server(
  {
    name: "demo-server",
    version: "1.0.0"
  },
  {
    // Define a simple tool
    tools: {
      greet: {
        description: "Greet a user by name",
        input: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            name: { type: "string" }
          },
          required: ["name"]
        },
        handler: async ({ name }) => {
          return `Hello ${name}, welcome to MCP!`;
        }
      }
    }
  }
);

// Run the server over stdio transport
async function main() {
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Server error:", err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

✅ When connected:

* AI asks → `greet("Alice")`
* Server responds → `"Hello Alice, welcome to MCP!"`

# 🔒 Security in MCP

MCP takes **security seriously** ⚔️:

* **User consent** required for sensitive actions.
* **OAuth / Scoped tokens** 🔑 for secure authorization.
* **No secrets in stdout** (important for stdio transport).
* **Treat AI as untrusted** → validate all inputs server-side.

👉 **Interview line:**
“MCP enforces safety by requiring explicit permissions, structured tool declarations, and secure transports like stdio or HTTP.”

* **Build Clients** → Create apps that connect to MCP servers.

👉 Example:

* A **Finance MCP Server** to fetch live stock data.
* A **Client Agent** (like ChatGPT plugin) that queries it for investment advice.

# 🗣️ Interview-Ready Answer

If asked: **“What is MCP?”**

> “The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard that lets AI applications securely connect to external data sources, tools, and workflows. It’s built on JSON-RPC and works over transports like stdio or HTTP. Servers expose capabilities like resources and tools, and clients (such as ChatGPT or Claude) consume them. I like to think of MCP as the USB-C for AI: a universal connector that makes AI systems extensible, secure, and interoperable.”
