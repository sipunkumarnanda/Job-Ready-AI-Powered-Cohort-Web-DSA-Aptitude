---

## ✅ **1. What is Middleware in Node.js / Express?**

**Middleware** is a **function** in Express that has access to the **request (`req`)**, **response (`res`)**, and the **next middleware** in the application’s request-response cycle.

### 👉 Syntax:

```js
(req, res, next) => { /* logic */ }
```

### ✅ Key Points:

* Runs **before** route handler.
* Can **modify** `req` or `res`.
* Can **end** the request or **pass** control using `next()`.

---

## ✅ **2. Why Do We Use Middleware?**

Middleware provides a **modular way to handle common functionalities** such as:

| Feature           | Use Case                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ✅ Logging         | Monitor incoming requests        |
| 🔐 Authentication | Validate user access             |
| 📦 Data Parsing   | Parse JSON, form data, cookies   |
| 🧪 Validation     | Validate input fields            |
| ❌ Error Handling  | Catch and handle errors globally |
| 🌍 CORS           | Manage cross-origin requests     |
| 💾 Caching        | Improve response time            |

---

## ✅ **3. How Does Middleware Work in Express?**

Middleware is **executed in sequence**, in the order it's defined.

### 👉 Flow:

```text
Client → Middleware 1 → Middleware 2 → Route Handler → Response
```

### 👉 Code Example:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Global middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request received');
    next(); // Go to the next middleware or route
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello from route!');
});
```

## ✅ **4. Types of Middleware in Express**

| Type                     | Description                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 📍 **Application-level** | Applied across the whole app using `app.use()` |
| 🔄 **Route-level**       | Applied to specific routes only                |
| ⚙️ **Built-in**          | Provided by Express (e.g., `express.json()`)   |
| 🌐 **Third-party**       | From npm packages (e.g., `cors`, `morgan`)     |
| 🚨 **Error-handling**    | Catches errors, has 4 arguments                |

---

## ✅ **5. Built-in Middleware Examples**

```js
app.use(express.json()); // Parses JSON body
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // Parses form data
app.use(express.static('public')); // Serves static files
```

---

## ✅ **6. Error-Handling Middleware**

Used to catch and respond to errors.

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});
```

> Must be defined **after** all routes.

---

## ✅ **7. Third-Party Middleware Example**

```bash
npm install morgan cors
```

```js
const morgan = require('morgan');
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(morgan('dev')); // HTTP logger
app.use(cors());        // Allow cross-origin requests
```

---

## ✅ **8. Route-Level Middleware Example**

```js
function checkAuth(req, res, next) {
    if (req.query.token === '123') next();
    else res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
}

app.get('/secure', checkAuth, (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the secure route!');
});
```

# 📋 Interview Questions and Sample Answers

---

### ❓ Q1. What is middleware in Express?

**Answer:**
Middleware is a function that processes the request before it reaches the route handler or after it gets a response. It has access to `req`, `res`, and `next()`. It's used for logging, authentication, validation, and error handling.

---

### ❓ Q2. What are the different types of middleware in Express?

**Answer:**

* Application-level
* Route-level
* Built-in middleware (`express.json()`)
* Third-party middleware (`morgan`, `cors`)
* Error-handling middleware

---

### ❓ Q3. What does `next()` do in middleware?

**Answer:**
It passes control to the **next middleware** function in the stack. If not called, the request will hang.

---

### ❓ Q4. Can a middleware end the request-response cycle?

**Answer:**
Yes. A middleware can send a response and **not call `next()`**, thus ending the cycle. Example: an auth check that returns 403.

---

### ❓ Q5. How do you handle errors in middleware?

**Answer:**
By defining an error-handling middleware with 4 parameters:

```js
(err, req, res, next)
```

---

### ❓ Q6. What's the difference between global and route-specific middleware?

**Answer:**

* Global (application-level) middleware applies to **all routes**.
* Route-specific applies to **one or more defined routes** only.

---

### ❓ Q7. How to use third-party middleware in Express?

**Answer:**

1. Install via npm (`npm install morgan`)
2. Import and use it:

```js
const morgan = require('morgan');
app.use(morgan('dev'));
```

---

### ❓ Q8. Can middleware be asynchronous?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can use `async/await` in middleware. Make sure to `try/catch` errors and pass them to `next(err)`.

```js
app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        // async logic
        next();
    } catch (err) {
        next(err);
    }
});
```
