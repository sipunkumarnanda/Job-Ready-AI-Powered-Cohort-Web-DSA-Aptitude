
# 📌 **Where Can We Use Middleware in Express?**

In **Express.js**, middleware can be used in **two main places** in the request-response cycle:

---

## ✅ **1. Between `app` and `router` (Application-level Middleware)**

### 📍 Description:

This middleware is placed **before defining routers**. It applies **globally to all routes** and executes on **every request**.

### 💡 Purpose:

* Logging
* Authentication
* CORS
* JSON body parsing
* Rate limiting

### 🔧 Example:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRouter = require('./routes/user');

// 🔹 Middleware between app and router
app.use(express.json()); // parse JSON body
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`[APP MIDDLEWARE] ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next();
});

// 🔹 Router setup
app.use('/users', userRouter); // mount user router

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running...');
});
```

### 🧠 Key Points:

* This middleware runs **before** hitting any router or route.
* Good for setup tasks or global checks.
* Applies to **all routers mounted with `app.use()`**.

## ✅ **2. Between `router` and `API/Route` (Router-level Middleware)**

### 📍 Description:

This middleware is added **inside a specific router**, and it executes **before the actual route/endpoint**.

### 💡 Purpose:

* Route-specific authentication
* Role-based access control
* Input validation
* Custom logging per module (e.g., user, admin)

### 🔧 Example:

```js
// routes/user.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// 🔹 Middleware between router and API
router.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('[ROUTER MIDDLEWARE] Inside user router');
    next();
});

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('User list');
});

module.exports = router;
```

### 🧠 Key Points:

* This middleware only applies to routes within this specific router.
* Helps modularize logic for different route groups.
* Ideal for authentication, validation per module (e.g., admin-only routes).

## 📊 **Comparison Table**

| Feature          | App ↔ Router Middleware      | Router ↔ API Middleware      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Scope            | Global (entire app)          | Local (specific router)      |
| Defined in       | `app.js` or main server file | Inside router file           |
| Common Use Cases | Logging, parsing, CORS       | Auth, validation, route logs |
| Syntax           | `app.use(middleware)`        | `router.use(middleware)`     |

## 🔄 **How Request Flows**

```txt
Client Request
   ↓
App-level Middleware (app.use)
   ↓
Route Middleware (router.use)
   ↓
Specific Route Handler (router.get/post etc.)
   ↓
Response to Client
```

---

## ✅ Summary

* **Middleware between app and router** is used for **global configurations** that apply to all routes (e.g., logging, body parsing).
* **Middleware between router and API** is used for **module-specific logic**, like **authentication**, **role checks**, or **input validation** within a particular route group.
