---

#### 📌 What is `systemInstruction`?

The `systemInstruction` field is part of the `config` object in the Gemini API. It allows you to **instruct the AI model on how it should behave, respond, or interpret the given input**, similar to how you'd give a briefing to a human assistant before assigning a task.

It acts like a **personality setup + task briefing** for the model.

#### 🔍 Purpose of `systemInstruction`

* To **guide the model’s tone, format, and response type**.
* Helps maintain **consistency across multiple prompts**.
* Reduces the need to repeat instructions in every prompt.
* Ensures **domain-specific behavior** (e.g., formal language for legal docs, friendly tone for chatbots).

#### 🧾 Example Used in Your Code

```js
systemInstruction: `
  Your task is to generate short and concise captions for images. 
  Keep the captions to 2-3 lines maximum. 
  Caption should be dark humor funny, with an adult vibe and a wink like dark comedy shows. 
  Use Hinglish (Hindi + English) in a dark comedy tone. 
  Always include relevant hashtags and a few emojis to match the vibe.
`
```

#### 🛠️ How It Helps in This Project

* Ensures **each caption** has the same tone/style (dark humor + Hinglish).
* You don’t have to re-specify the tone in every prompt.
* The model adapts its behavior without changing your frontend/backend logic.

---

#### ⚠️ Best Practices

* Be **clear and specific**: Vague instructions can lead to inconsistent results.
* Avoid overloading the instruction with too many constraints.
* Test iteratively and refine based on real model outputs.
* Keep it **short and focused** on guiding the behavior—not on generating actual output.
