
## 🔐 What happens when a user logs in or creates an account?

1. **User enters credentials** (like username/email and password).
2. The **server verifies** this information:

   * If the user is new, it **creates a new user** in the database.
   * If the user already exists, it **checks the password** (usually after hashing it).
3. Once the server confirms that this is a valid user, it **creates a token** (often a **JWT – JSON Web Token**) and **sends it back to the user**.

## 🎫 What is the token?

A **token** is a **signed piece of data** that proves who the user is. Think of it like an **ID card** or a **pass**.

It usually contains:

* The **user's ID** (e.g., `user_id: 12345`)
* Possibly a **role** (like `admin`, `user`, etc.)
* **Expiration time**
* Other metadata if needed

> 🔑 This token is usually signed using a secret key that only the server knows — so it can't be easily faked.

## 🤔 How does the server know **which user** is making a request?

When many users send requests, the **token** is how the server keeps track of **who is who**.

Here's how:

1. When a user logs in, the server gives them a token.

2. The user's **frontend (browser/app)** stores that token (usually in **localStorage**, **sessionStorage**, or a **cookie**).

3. Every time the user makes a request (like GET, POST, etc.), the **token is included** in the request:

   * Usually in the **Authorization** header like this:

     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
     ```

4. The server receives the request and:

   * **Reads the token**
   * **Decodes it** to see which user sent it
   * **Verifies** it using the secret key (to make sure it’s not fake or expired)
   * If valid, the server knows: “This request is coming from user with ID 12345”

---

## 🧠 So how does the server handle multiple users making requests at the same time?

* Each request comes with its own **token**.
* The server **checks each token individually**.
* Based on the **user ID or role** inside the token, the server can:

  * Allow access
  * Fetch that user's data
  * Apply permissions
  * Reject if token is invalid or expired

It doesn’t matter if thousands of users are sending requests — the **server checks the token in each request**, one by one.

## 📦 Example of a token (JWT)

This is what a token might look like (simplified):

```json
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "user",
  "exp": 1721859192
}
```

It’s encoded and signed, so it looks like a long string when sent:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## 🔁 Summary

* ✅ Each user gets a unique token after login or signup.
* 📦 The token contains the user's identity and other info.
* 📲 The client sends this token with every request.
* 🧠 The server decodes the token to know which user is sending the request.
* 🔐 Server uses this to securely handle thousands of users at the same time.
