
# 🧠 Why Do We Use **Middleware** in Express?

In Express, **middleware functions** are like **custom functions that sit between the request and the response**. They can inspect, modify, or terminate the request-response cycle.

> Middleware lets you **plug in logic at various stages** before sending the final response.

---

## 🛠️ What Is Middleware?

> A middleware is a function that has access to:

```js
(req, res, next)
```

Where:

* `req`: The request object
* `res`: The response object
* `next`: A function that calls the **next middleware** in the chain

### 🧩 Example Use Cases of Middleware:

| Use Case                  | Description                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `express.json()`          | Parses incoming JSON data in the body                |
| Authentication middleware | Check if user is logged in                           |
| Logging middleware        | Log every request to the server                      |
| Error-handling middleware | Catch and format server errors                       |
| Static file middleware    | Serve images, CSS, JS files using `express.static()` |

## 🔄 Middleware Flow Example:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Middleware triggered");
  next(); // Pass to next handler
});
```

---

## 🧪 Real World Example

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON

app.post("/api/data", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // Now this works because express.json() parsed it
  res.send("Data received");
});
```

If you **don’t use `express.json()`**, `req.body` will be `undefined` when client sends JSON!

---

# 📦 What Does `express.json()` Do?

```js
app.use(express.json());
```

It tells Express to:

* Automatically **parse incoming JSON** data
* Add it to `req.body`
* So you can easily read it in your route handlers

---

## 🧠 Without `express.json()`

```js
app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // ❌ undefined
});
```

With `express.json()`:

```js
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body); // ✅ Parsed JSON object
});
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Concept          | Meaning                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Middleware       | Functions that run during the request/response process         |
| `express.json()` | Built-in middleware that parses JSON body of incoming requests |
| `next()`         | Moves the request to the next middleware or route handler      |
