
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ MongoDB OPS/Second üíæ

* MongoDB is a **disk-backed document database**, optimized for durability, indexing, and querying.
* Typical **write throughput** (single node, normal hardware):

  * **Inserts:** \~1,000 ‚Äì 10,000 OPS/sec
  * **Updates:** \~500 ‚Äì 5,000 OPS/sec
  * **Reads:** \~5,000 ‚Äì 20,000 OPS/sec
* Performance depends heavily on:

  * Indexing strategy
  * Document size
  * Disk I/O
  * Replication (primary/secondary sync)
* MongoDB trades **raw speed** for **flexibility and persistence**.

> Key takeaway: MongoDB is slower for high-frequency ephemeral operations (like STM in AI chat).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Redis OPS/Second üî•

* Redis is an **in-memory key-value store**, optionally persistent to disk (RDB/AOF).
* Typical **throughput**:

  * **Single instance:** 100,000 ‚Äì 1,000,000 OPS/sec (reads & writes)
  * **Clustered Redis:** millions of OPS/sec across nodes
* Performance depends on:

  * Network latency
  * Memory size
  * Command complexity (simple GET/SET are fastest; large sorted set operations slightly slower)
* Redis trades **memory usage** for **extremely high speed**.

> Key takeaway: Redis is ideal for ephemeral, high-frequency workloads like AI STM, caching, and real-time messaging.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ OPS Comparison Table üìä

| Database | Typical Writes (OPS/sec) | Typical Reads (OPS/sec) | Strengths                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| MongoDB  | 1k ‚Äì 10k                 | 5k ‚Äì 20k                | Persistence, rich queries, flexible schemas     |
| Redis    | 100k ‚Äì 1M+               | 100k ‚Äì 1M+              | Ultra-fast in-memory, low latency, pub/sub, TTL |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Implication for AI STM üß†

* **MongoDB:** Good for **long-term memory**, user history, and persistent storage. Not ideal for hundreds of messages per second in a real-time chat session.
* **Redis:** Perfect for **short-term memory** (STM), caching, ephemeral session data, and high-frequency AI message ops.
