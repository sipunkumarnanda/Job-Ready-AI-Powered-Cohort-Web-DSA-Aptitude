---

## 📝 1. **Text Data (Books, Websites, Code, Articles)**

* **GPT-3 (175B params)** → trained on \~**570 GB of text** (\~300B tokens).
* **GPT-4 / Gemini Ultra** → estimated **10–100x more**.

  * Likely **10–20 TB of cleaned text** (\~1–2 trillion tokens).
  * Sources: Books, Wikipedia, Common Crawl, GitHub, news, research papers, etc.

👉 Easy analogy: That’s like storing **10–20 million eBooks** 📚.

## 🖼️ 2. **Image Data (for Multimodal LLMs like Gemini Pro/Ultra)**

* Image training needs **paired datasets (image + caption/alt text)**.

* **CLIP (OpenAI vision model)** used \~400M images.

* Gemini Ultra is estimated to use **billions of images**.

* Raw size:

  * If 1 image ≈ 1 MB → **1B images ≈ 1 PB**.
  * If compressed → \~**100–500 TB** of image data.

👉 Equivalent to storing **millions of HD photos from Instagram** 📸.

## 🎥 3. **Video Data (for advanced multimodal like Gemini Ultra)**

* Video is **much heavier** than text/images.
* 1 minute of HD video ≈ **100 MB**.
* If model uses **millions of hours of video**:

  * 1M hours ≈ **6 PB of video data**.
* Not all video is stored raw → many are **compressed & sampled (frames only)**.

👉 Equivalent to **hundreds of years of nonstop YouTube videos** 🎬.

## 🌍 4. **Total Data Scale**

* **Gemini Ultra / GPT-4 Multimodal** likely trained on:

  * **Text:** \~10–20 TB
  * **Images:** \~100–500 TB
  * **Video:** \~1–6 PB
* Grand Total: **Several Petabytes (PBs)** 😲

👉 To put that in perspective:

* **1 PB = 1,000 TB = 1,000,000 GB**.
* Enough to fill **250,000 modern laptops (4TB each)**.

## ⚡ Why So Much?

* The model needs **diverse knowledge**: language, facts, images, reasoning, real-world dynamics.
* More data = better generalization.
* But: Data must be **cleaned + deduplicated**, so raw collection is even larger.

✅ **In One Line:**
Training Gemini Ultra likely requires **tens of terabytes of text, hundreds of terabytes of images, and multiple petabytes of video** — together, several **petabytes of high-quality multimodal data** 🌍💾.
