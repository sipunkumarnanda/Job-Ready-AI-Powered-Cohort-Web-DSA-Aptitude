**MCP** (which stands for **Model Context Protocol**) is being described as a **standardized way for applications to provide context to large language models (LLMs).**

1. **Why context matters for LLMs:**

   * Large language models like GPT generate responses based on the input they receive.
   * To make them useful in real-world applications, they often need **additional context**: documents, user data, APIs, or other tools.
   * Without a standard, every app might connect to an LLM differently, making it hard to share or scale workflows.

2. **The USB-C analogy:**

   * USB-C is a **universal port** that allows you to connect many devices (phones, laptops, chargers, monitors) without worrying about compatibility.
   * Similarly, **MCP is a universal “port” for LLMs**. It allows any application to provide context to a model in a standardized way.
   * This makes it easier for developers to **connect different data sources, tools, or APIs** to the LLM.

3. **What MCP enables:**

   * **Agents**: Programs that can take actions using an LLM. For example, a chatbot that can check your calendar or send emails.
   * **Complex workflows**: You can chain multiple tools or data sources together in a predictable way. For example: extract data from a spreadsheet → summarize it → send a report.
   * **Integration with the real world**: MCP makes it easier for LLMs to interact with external systems (like databases, sensors, or APIs) because there’s a standardized way to provide that information.

**In short:** MCP is like a universal adapter that makes it easy to feed LLMs the right context, connect them to tools, and build smarter, more capable AI applications.
