---

## 1. Function Definition

```js
async function userLogout(req, res) {
```

* 🔹 Defines an **asynchronous function** called `userLogout`.
* 🔹 It takes two parameters:

  * `req` → request object (contains info about the HTTP request).
  * `res` → response object (used to send back a response to the client).
* 🔹 Being `async` allows it to handle asynchronous tasks if needed (like database calls or API requests).

## 2. Clearing the Cookie

```js
   res.clearCookie('token')
```

* 🍪 **Clears the cookie named `token`** from the client’s browser.
* 🚪 This is typically used to remove the **authentication token** (like a JWT).
* 🛡️ Ensures the user is effectively **logged out** by invalidating their session/token.

## 3. Redirecting the User

```js
   return res.redirect('/auth/login')
```

* 🔁 Sends a **redirect response** to the client.
* 📍 Redirects the user to the `/auth/login` page.
* 🎯 This ensures that after logout, the user is taken back to the **login page** instead of staying on a protected route.

## 4. Closing the Function

```js
}
```

* ✅ Marks the **end of the function** definition.
* ✨ Function is now ready to be used as a route handler for logout.

# 🌟 Summary

The `userLogout` function:

1. 🧹 **Clears the authentication cookie** (`token`) → logs the user out.
2. 🚀 **Redirects the user to `/auth/login`** → guides them back to the login page.
3. 🔐 This is a **standard logout mechanism** in Express.js apps that use cookies for authentication.
