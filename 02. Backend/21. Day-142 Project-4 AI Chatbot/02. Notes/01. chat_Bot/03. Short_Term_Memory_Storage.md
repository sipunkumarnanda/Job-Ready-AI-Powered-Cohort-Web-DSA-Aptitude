
Yes — but here’s the important distinction 👇

In **short-term memory**, the **old prompts are not magically remembered by the LLM**.
They are stored **on your side** (in your app, server, browser, or database) and *then* re-sent to the model with each new request.

Here’s how it works step-by-step:

---

### 1️⃣ Where it’s stored

* **If you’re running a local chatbot** → old conversation data is stored in your **local app memory** (RAM) or a small local database (like SQLite, JSON file, etc.).
* **If you’re running a web-based chatbot** → the conversation history is stored:

  * In the **server’s memory** (RAM) for active sessions, or
  * In a **database** (if you want to keep it between page reloads), or
  * In **browser localStorage / sessionStorage** for purely client-side apps.

---

### 2️⃣ Why we store it

* The LLM **doesn’t have persistent memory**. Every time you send a request, it only sees what’s in the current prompt.
* If you want it to “remember” earlier messages, **you have to save them somewhere** and include them in the prompt again.

### 3️⃣ What actually happens

Let’s say your chat looks like this:

**You:** "Hi, my name is John"
**Bot:** "Hi John! How can I help you today?"
**You:** "What’s my name?"

When you send `"What’s my name?"` to the LLM, your backend will *also* send the previous messages, like this:

```
System: "You are a helpful chatbot."
User: "Hi, my name is John"
Assistant: "Hi John! How can I help you today?"
User: "What’s my name?"
```

The LLM sees the full text block above, so it can reply: `"Your name is John."`

### 4️⃣ Where it’s **not** stored

* The LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) **does not automatically save your history** for future calls.
* If you don’t store it on your side, it’s gone after the request.

If you want, I can draw you a **small diagram** showing where short-term memory lives and how it’s sent to the LLM each time. That makes it click for most people.
