---

## 1. 🔍 **What is Node.js?**

* **Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform **JavaScript runtime environment**.
* It allows you to **run JavaScript outside the browser**, directly on the machine (typically a server).
* It is **built on the Chrome V8 engine**, which compiles JavaScript to machine code for faster execution.
* Node.js is designed to build **scalable, high-performance, and real-time applications**, such as:

  * Web servers
  * REST APIs
  * Chat applications
  * IoT services

> **Key Feature**: Node.js uses a **non-blocking, event-driven architecture**, making it lightweight and efficient.

## 2. 👨‍💻 **Who Created Node.js and Why?**

* **Created by**: Ryan Dahl
* **Initial Release**: 2009
* **Primary Motivation**:

  * Traditional web servers (like Apache) handled many concurrent requests inefficiently using a blocking I/O model.
  * Node.js introduced **asynchronous programming** to handle **thousands of concurrent connections** with ease.
  * Promotes **Single Threaded Event Loop** model — powerful for I/O-heavy operations (e.g., file/network access).

## 3. 🛠️ **Installing Node.js**

### Steps:

1. Visit the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the version that suits your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### You’ll see two options:

* **LTS (Long-Term Support)**: Stable, recommended for most users and production apps.
* **Current**: Latest features, but might have bugs or experimental APIs.

> After installation, verify in terminal:

```bash
node -v    # shows Node.js version
npm -v     # shows npm (Node Package Manager) version
```

## 4. ▶️ **Running JavaScript with Node.js**

Once Node.js is installed, you can run any `.js` file directly from your terminal:

```bash
node app.js
```

You can also use the **Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**:

```bash
node
> console.log("Hello Node.js");
```

## 5. 📦 **What Are Packages in Node.js?**

* A **package** is a collection of JavaScript code (functions, classes, tools) that solves specific problems or adds features.
* Managed via **npm (Node Package Manager)**.
* Stored in `node_modules/` directory and tracked in `package.json`.

### Example:

```bash
npm install cat-me
```

This installs the `cat-me` package locally (into your project folder).

## 6. 📚 **Packages vs Modules in Node.js**

| Feature      | **Package**                     | **Module**                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| What it is   | Reusable 3rd-party code/tool    | Self-contained piece of code (built-in or custom) |
| Installation | Requires `npm install`          | Comes with Node.js (or created manually)          |
| Examples     | `express`, `mongoose`, `cat-me` | `fs`, `http`, `path`, `os`, `events`              |

> ✅ You can create your own **custom modules** by exporting functions using `module.exports`.

## 7. 🐱 **Installing & Using a Package (Example: cat-me)**

### Step 1: Install the package

```bash
npm install cat-me
```

### Step 2: Use it in your Node.js file

```js
const catMe = require("cat-me");

console.log(catMe()); // prints a random ASCII cat
```

### Notes:

* This is a fun utility library that prints cat faces 🐱 in the console.
* It helps understand how to `require()` and use installed packages.

## 8. 🌐 **Using the Built-in `http` Module in Node.js**

Node.js provides many built-in modules to handle core functionalities — one of them is `http`.

* The `http` module allows you to:

  * Create a web server
  * Handle requests and send responses
  * Build RESTful APIs

> You **do not need to install** it — just `require('http')`.

---

## 9. 💻 **Creating a Simple HTTP Server with Node.js**

```js
const http = require('http');

// Create a server instance
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }); // optional header
  res.end("Hello from Node.js server!");
});

// Start the server and listen on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

### Breakdown:

* `createServer()` takes a callback function with two arguments:

  * `req`: Incoming request object
  * `res`: Outgoing response object
* `res.end()` is used to send the final response and close the connection.
* `server.listen()` tells the server to start and listen on a specific port.

> Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the output.
