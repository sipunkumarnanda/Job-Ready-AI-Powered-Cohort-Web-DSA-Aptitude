In web development, a **template** is a **pre-designed file or layout** that contains **placeholders or dynamic parts** which can be filled with data at runtime. Templates help you **avoid writing repetitive HTML** for every page and make your application **dynamic and maintainable**.

## 🧠 Concept

* A template is like a **blueprint** or **skeleton** of a page.
* It contains **static HTML** (always the same) and **dynamic placeholders** (change based on data).
* When processed by a **template engine**, the placeholders are replaced with **real values**, producing the final HTML sent to the browser.

## ⚙️ Example of a Template (EJS)

**`index.ejs`**

```ejs
<h1>Welcome, <%= user.name %>!</h1>

<ul>
  <% posts.forEach(post => { %>
    <li><%= post.title %></li>
  <% }) %>
</ul>
```

* `<%= user.name %>` → placeholder for the user’s name.
* `<% posts.forEach(...) %>` → loop placeholder for a list of posts.
* The rest of the HTML is static (header, `<ul>`, etc.).

When rendered with data:

```js
res.render('index', { user: { name: 'Alice' }, posts: [{title:'Hello'}, {title:'EJS'}] });
```

**Generated HTML sent to browser:**

```html
<h1>Welcome, Alice!</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Hello</li>
  <li>EJS</li>
</ul>
```

## 🔑 Key Points

* A **template** is **not the final page**; it’s the “draft” with placeholders.
* It becomes a full HTML page **only when processed by a template engine**.
* Templates improve **reusability**: one template can render hundreds of pages with different data.
* In Express + EJS, `.ejs` files are templates.

## 💡 Analogy

* Template = **empty cake mold**
* Template engine + data = **baked cake with flavor & decorations**
* Browser sees = **finished cake ready to eat**

✅ Summary:
A **template** is a **predefined layout with placeholders**. It’s a mix of **static content + dynamic parts** that can be filled with data to generate **final HTML**.
