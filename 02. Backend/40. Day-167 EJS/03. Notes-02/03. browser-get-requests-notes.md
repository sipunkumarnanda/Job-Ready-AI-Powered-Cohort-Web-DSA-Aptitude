
# ❓ Are all requests from the browser address bar `GET` requests? 🧩

Yes — **all requests made by typing a URL in the browser’s address bar are `GET` requests**. Let’s break this down carefully.

---

## 🧠 Concept

* Browsers support multiple HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

* When you **type a URL in the address bar and press Enter**, the browser:

  1. Constructs an **HTTP request**.
  2. The **default method** for such requests is **`GET`**.
  3. Sends it to the server.

* **Why `GET`?**

  * Browsing a page is **retrieving information**, which aligns with the purpose of `GET`.
  * `POST` (or other methods) usually involve **sending data to the server**, which doesn’t happen automatically when you just type a URL.

## 🔧 Example

Typing in browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

**HTTP request generated by the browser:**

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
```

* Express route that handles it:

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

* Response: `"Hello World!"`

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **Forms can override method**

   * If you submit a form, it can use `GET` or `POST`.
   * Forms default to `GET` if method is not specified.

2. **AJAX / Fetch / XHR requests**

   * JavaScript can send `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` requests programmatically.
   * But these are **not triggered by typing a URL in the browser bar**.

3. **Refresh or navigation**

   * Typing a URL, clicking a link, or refreshing a page → all result in **`GET` requests**.

## ✅ Summary

* **All requests from the browser address bar are `GET` requests.**
* `GET` is for **retrieving resources**, not sending data.
* Other methods (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) require **forms, scripts, or API calls**.
