---

## ❌ Why We Don’t Use the Native `http` Module Directly

### Drawbacks:

* Requires more **boilerplate code** to handle basic tasks like routing, parsing data, setting headers.
* No support for **routes**, **middleware**, or **template engines**.
* Difficult to scale for larger applications.

### Example (native http):

```js
const http = require('http');
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/' && req.method === 'GET') {
    res.write("Hello");
    res.end();
  }
}).listen(3000);
```

😵 Imagine adding 10+ routes manually like this.

## 🚀 What is Express?

### Definition:

> **Express** is a lightweight, minimal and flexible **Node.js web application framework** that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### Benefits:

* Easy to set up and get started.
* Built-in support for routing.
* Supports middleware, templating engines, and easy request handling.
* Large community and ecosystem.

---

## 🛠️ Install and Setup Express

### Install using npm:

```bash
npm install express
```

### Initialize in your code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

🧠 `express()` returns an **application instance**, which you use to define routes, middleware, and configuration.

---

## ▶️ Start Express Server

```js
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

* Starts a server that listens on the given port.
* No output will be shown unless routes are defined.

---

## 🧪 Make Your First Request

* Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in browser.
* You’ll see:

  ```
  Cannot GET /
  ```

  That means the server is up, but there’s no route defined yet.

---

## 🔗 What is an API?

> API = Application Programming Interface

* A set of defined **rules and endpoints** that allow communication between **client and server**.
* APIs expose certain data or services from a system, so other systems can consume it.

### Example:

Your backend might provide APIs for:

* `/login`
* `/get-user`
* `/products`

---

## 🌐 What are REST APIs?

### REST = Representational State Transfer

A **convention** for designing APIs using **HTTP methods**:

| Method | Usage       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| GET    | Read data   |
| POST   | Create data |
| PUT    | Update data |
| DELETE | Remove data |

### RESTful API Example:

```http
GET /users          → list all users  
GET /users/:id      → get one user  
POST /users         → create user  
PUT /users/:id      → update user  
DELETE /users/:id   → delete user
```

---

## 📍 Creating Routes in Express

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});
```

This sets up a route that listens for a **GET request on `/`** and responds with `"Hello World"`.

---

## 📥 What is `req`?

> `req` stands for **Request Object**

### Contains:

* `req.url` → path requested
* `req.method` → HTTP method
* `req.query` → data from query string
* `req.params` → data from route parameters
* `req.body` → data sent in POST/PUT

---

## 📤 What is `res`?

> `res` stands for **Response Object**

### Common Methods:

* `res.send()` → send text/html
* `res.json()` → send JSON
* `res.status()` → set HTTP status code
* `res.redirect()` → redirect to another route

---

## 📨 3 Ways to Send Data to the Server

### 1. `req.body`

* Used in: `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`
* Must use middleware like `express.json()` to parse body

```js
app.use(express.json());
```

```js
app.post('/user', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
});
```

---

### 2. `req.query`

* Data passed after `?` in URL.
* Example:

  ```
  /search?name=ram&age=22
  ```
* Access using:

  ```js
  req.query.name  // "ram"
  req.query.age   // "22"
  ```

---

### 3. `req.params`

* Data passed directly in the URL path.
* Example:

  ```
  /user/ram
  ```

```js
app.get('/user/:username', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.params.username); // ram
});
```

---

## 🔄 Request-Response Lifecycle in Express

1. **Client Sends Request**

   * Browser or Postman sends HTTP request.
2. **Server Receives It**

   * Express server picks it up.
3. **Routing Layer Checks**

   * Express matches the route + method (`GET /home`)
4. **Middleware Runs** (optional)

   * Logging, auth, validation, etc.
5. **Route Handler Executes**

   * Processes logic, queries DB, etc.
6. **Server Sends Response**

   * Using `res.send()`, `res.json()`, etc.
7. **Client Gets Response**

   * Result shown in browser or Postman.

---

## 🧰 BONUS: Middleware in Express

Middleware functions are functions that run **between request and response**.

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("New request received");
  next(); // move to the next middleware or route
});
```

Used for:

* Logging
* Authentication
* Validation
* Parsing body (`express.json()`)
