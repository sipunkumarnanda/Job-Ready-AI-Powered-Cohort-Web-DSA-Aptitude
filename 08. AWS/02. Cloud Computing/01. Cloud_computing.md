## 🔹 What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is the **delivery of computing services** (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more) **over the internet ("the cloud")** instead of using local computers or servers.

---

## 🔹 Key Characteristics

✨ **On-demand service** – Get resources whenever needed.
✨ **Scalability** – Easily increase or decrease resources.
✨ **Pay-as-you-go** – Pay only for what you use.
✨ **Accessibility** – Access from anywhere with internet.
✨ **Resource pooling** – Multiple users share resources efficiently.

## 🔹 Types of Cloud Services (💡 Cloud Service Models)

* 🖥️ **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized hardware like servers, storage, and networking. Example: AWS EC2.
* ⚙️ **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides platforms to build, test, and deploy applications. Example: Google App Engine.
* 📦 **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Provides ready-to-use software over the internet. Example: Gmail, Zoom.

## 🔹 Types of Cloud Deployment

* ☁️ **Public Cloud:** Services available to everyone (e.g., AWS, Azure).
* 🏠 **Private Cloud:** Used by a single organization, more secure.
* 🔄 **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public & private clouds.
* 🌍 **Multi-Cloud:** Using multiple cloud providers together.

## 🔹 Advantages of Cloud Computing

✅ Cost-effective (no need for physical hardware)
✅ High scalability & flexibility
✅ Data backup & disaster recovery
✅ Global accessibility
✅ Collaboration made easier

## 🔹 Challenges / Disadvantages

⚠️ Security & privacy concerns
⚠️ Downtime & internet dependency
⚠️ Vendor lock-in (hard to switch providers)

# 🖥️ Virtualization in Cloud Computing

## 🔹 How Cloud Providers Offer VMs

* Cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, GCP) use **virtualization technology** to create **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.
* A **Hypervisor** (software layer) runs on physical servers to **divide hardware resources** (CPU, RAM, storage, network) into multiple virtual environments.
* Each **VM acts like an independent computer** with its own OS and applications.

## 🔹 Types of Hypervisors

1. **Type 1 (Bare-metal):** Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V).
2. **Type 2 (Hosted):** Runs on top of a host OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).

---

## 🔹 Why Virtualization is Important in Cloud

✨ Efficient resource utilization
✨ Isolation between users/applications
✨ Scalability & flexibility (easy to create/delete VMs)
✨ Cost-saving with shared physical servers

---

⚡ **In short:** Cloud providers use **hypervisors** to virtualize physical hardware → create multiple **VMs** → deliver them to users as **IaaS** services.
