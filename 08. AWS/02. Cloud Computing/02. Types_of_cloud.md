## 🖥️ 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

👉 **What it is:** Provides **raw IT infrastructure** (servers, storage, networking) on demand.
👉 **Analogy:** Like **renting an empty apartment** – you get the space, but you must bring your own furniture, design, and maintenance.
👉 **Example:** AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure VMs.
👉 **Use Case:** Hosting virtual machines, data storage, backups, test environments.

## ⚙️ 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)

👉 **What it is:** Provides a **platform with tools & runtime environment** to build, run, and deploy applications – no need to manage underlying infrastructure.
👉 **Analogy:** Like **renting a fully furnished apartment** – you just bring your personal belongings and start living.
👉 **Example:** Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku.
👉 **Use Case:** Application development, testing, and deployment.

## 📦 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)

👉 **What it is:** Provides **ready-to-use software applications** over the internet.
👉 **Analogy:** Like **staying in a hotel** – everything is already set up (furniture, food, cleaning); you just use the services.
👉 **Example:** Gmail, Zoom, Microsoft 365, Dropbox.
👉 **Use Case:** Email services, video conferencing, CRM, collaboration tools.

## 📝 Quick Memory Trick

* 🖥️ **IaaS → “You manage most”** (infrastructure given, you build on top).
* ⚙️ **PaaS → “You manage apps”** (platform ready, just code & deploy).
* 📦 **SaaS → “You just use”** (software fully ready).
