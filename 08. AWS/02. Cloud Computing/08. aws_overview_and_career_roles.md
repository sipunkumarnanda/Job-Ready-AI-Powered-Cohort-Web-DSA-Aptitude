## 📌 Introduction

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the **world’s leading cloud computing platform**, launched in **2006**. It provides on-demand services such as **compute power, storage, networking, databases, AI/ML, IoT**, and more.

👉 Think of AWS as a **giant digital toolbox**, where you only pay for the tools you use.

## 💰 Pay-as-You-Go Model

* Just like **electricity or water bills**, AWS charges only for the resources you consume.
* Example: If you run a virtual server (EC2) for 3 hours, you pay only for those 3 hours, not for the entire day or month.

## 📜 AWS History

* **2006** – AWS launched as the **first public cloud platform**.
* **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** → First storage service.
* **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** → First compute service.
* Today, AWS has **200+ fully featured services** across AI, ML, IoT, Security, Databases, etc.

## 🌍 What Makes AWS Special?

1. **⚖️ Scalability** → Easily scale up or down depending on demand.

   * Analogy: Like increasing or decreasing seats in a movie theater based on the audience.

2. **🌐 Global Reach** → Data centers (AWS Regions) spread worldwide for faster access.

3. **🛡️ Security** → Strong compliance, encryption, and monitoring.

4. **⏱️ Reliability** → Built-in redundancy ensures services rarely go down.
